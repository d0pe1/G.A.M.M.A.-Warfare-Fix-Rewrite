# Dev Diary


## Prescope: Clone baseline
- **Task ID**: Setup & Diff Analysis - Clone baseline
- **Agent**: DiffAnalysisAgent (initial setup)
- **Summary**: Create `gamma_walo` directory containing baseline files from `runtime files` for later modification.

### Scope & Context
- Affects directory structure; no Lua code changes yet.
- Provides starting point for future systems.

### Dependencies
- None. This is first step.

### Data Flow Analysis
- Input: baseline files from `runtime files`.
- Output: identical files under `gamma_walo`.
- No downstream consumers yet.

### Failure Cases
- Missing files could break diff analysis later.
- Ensure directory paths preserve structure.

### Test Plan
- Verify copied files exist and match originals via `diff`.

### Rollback & Risk
- Low risk. Delete `gamma_walo` to rollback.


### Implementation Notes
Cloned baseline scripts and configs from `runtime files` into the new `gamma_walo` directory. Only files referenced by `old walo` and `gammas patch` were copied to keep the repository lightweight.
