# Dev Diary


## Prescope: Clone baseline
- **Task ID**: Setup & Diff Analysis - Clone baseline
- **Agent**: DiffAnalysisAgent (initial setup)
- **Summary**: Create `gamma_walo` directory containing baseline files from `runtime files` for later modification.

### Scope & Context
- Affects directory structure; no Lua code changes yet.
- Provides starting point for future systems.

### Dependencies
- None. This is first step.

### Data Flow Analysis
- Input: baseline files from `runtime files`.
- Output: identical files under `gamma_walo`.
- No downstream consumers yet.

### Failure Cases
- Missing files could break diff analysis later.
- Ensure directory paths preserve structure.

### Test Plan
- Verify copied files exist and match originals via `diff`.

### Rollback & Risk
- Low risk. Delete `gamma_walo` to rollback.


### Implementation Notes
Cloned baseline scripts and configs from `runtime files` into the new `gamma_walo` directory. Only files referenced by `old walo` and `gammas patch` were copied to keep the repository lightweight.

## Prescope: Run Analyzer profile
- **Task ID**: Setup & Diff Analysis - Run Analyzer profile
- **Agent**: DiffAnalysisAgent
- **Summary**: Generate reports comparing baseline runtime scripts against old_walo and gammas patch. Create docs/runtime_vs_gamma_walo.md and docs/api_map.md.

### Scope & Context
- New script at `gamma_walo/tools/analyzer.py`.
- Reads files under `runtime files`, `old walo`, and `gammas patch`.
- Outputs Markdown docs under `docs/`.

### Dependencies
- None. Files already present.

### Data Flow Analysis
- Input: script directories.
- Output: diff summary and API map docs.
- Downstream tasks will use docs to plan merges.

### Failure Cases
- Missing files paths cause crashes.
- Large diff may produce oversized docs. Limit context lines.

### Test Plan
- Run `python3 gamma_walo/tools/analyzer.py`
- Confirm docs/runtime_vs_gamma_walo.md and docs/api_map.md generated.
- Spot-check that diff summaries mention known differences.

### Rollback & Risk
- Low risk; docs only. Delete docs to rollback.


## Prescope: Summarize old_walo conflicts
- **Task ID**: WALO port - Summarize conflicts
- **Agent**: DiffAnalysisAgent
- **Summary**: Review `docs/runtime_vs_gamma_walo.md` for every `old_walo` file and summarise major differences vs baseline for merge planning.

### Scope & Context
- Affects documentation only.
- Inputs: diff report under `docs/runtime_vs_gamma_walo.md`.
- Output: new doc `docs/conflict_summary.md`.

### Dependencies
- None.

### Data Flow Analysis
- Read diff lines for each file.
- Summarize conflicts and features to port.
- No direct downstream yet but required for port tasks.

### Failure Cases
- Missing diff lines might lead to incomplete summary.

### Test Plan
- Ensure `docs/conflict_summary.md` contains a section per file listing key differences.

### Rollback & Risk
- Low risk: doc only. Delete file to rollback.

### Implementation Notes
Created `docs/conflict_summary.md` summarizing key differences between
`old_walo` scripts and the baseline runtime. This will guide future
merge work for the WALO port task.
