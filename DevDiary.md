# Dev Diary


## Prescope: Clone baseline
- **Task ID**: Setup & Diff Analysis - Clone baseline
- **Agent**: DiffAnalysisAgent (initial setup)
- **Summary**: Create `gamma_walo` directory containing baseline files from `runtime files` for later modification.

### Scope & Context
- Affects directory structure; no Lua code changes yet.
- Provides starting point for future systems.

### Dependencies
- None. This is first step.

### Data Flow Analysis
- Input: baseline files from `runtime files`.
- Output: identical files under `gamma_walo`.
- No downstream consumers yet.

### Failure Cases
- Missing files could break diff analysis later.
- Ensure directory paths preserve structure.

### Test Plan
- Verify copied files exist and match originals via `diff`.

### Rollback & Risk
- Low risk. Delete `gamma_walo` to rollback.


### Implementation Notes
Cloned baseline scripts and configs from `runtime files` into the new `gamma_walo` directory. Only files referenced by `old walo` and `gammas patch` were copied to keep the repository lightweight.

## Prescope: Run Analyzer profile
- **Task ID**: Setup & Diff Analysis - Run Analyzer profile
- **Agent**: DiffAnalysisAgent
- **Summary**: Generate reports comparing baseline runtime scripts against old_walo and gammas patch. Create docs/runtime_vs_gamma_walo.md and docs/api_map.md.

### Scope & Context
- New script at `gamma_walo/tools/analyzer.py`.
- Reads files under `runtime files`, `old walo`, and `gammas patch`.
- Outputs Markdown docs under `docs/`.

### Dependencies
- None. Files already present.

### Data Flow Analysis
- Input: script directories.
- Output: diff summary and API map docs.
- Downstream tasks will use docs to plan merges.

### Failure Cases
- Missing files paths cause crashes.
- Large diff may produce oversized docs. Limit context lines.

### Test Plan
- Run `python3 gamma_walo/tools/analyzer.py`
- Confirm docs/runtime_vs_gamma_walo.md and docs/api_map.md generated.
- Spot-check that diff summaries mention known differences.

### Rollback & Risk
- Low risk; docs only. Delete docs to rollback.


## Prescope: Summarize old_walo conflicts
- **Task ID**: WALO port - Summarize conflicts
- **Agent**: DiffAnalysisAgent
- **Summary**: Review `docs/runtime_vs_gamma_walo.md` for every `old_walo` file and summarise major differences vs baseline for merge planning.

### Scope & Context
- Affects documentation only.
- Inputs: diff report under `docs/runtime_vs_gamma_walo.md`.
- Output: new doc `docs/conflict_summary.md`.

### Dependencies
- None.

### Data Flow Analysis
- Read diff lines for each file.
- Summarize conflicts and features to port.
- No direct downstream yet but required for port tasks.

### Failure Cases
- Missing diff lines might lead to incomplete summary.

### Test Plan
- Ensure `docs/conflict_summary.md` contains a section per file listing key differences.

### Rollback & Risk
- Low risk: doc only. Delete file to rollback.

### Implementation Notes
Created `docs/conflict_summary.md` summarizing key differences between
`old_walo` scripts and the baseline runtime. This will guide future
merge work for the WALO port task.

## Prescope: Summarize gammas_patch conflicts
- **Task ID**: WALO port - Summarize conflicts between gammas patch and runtime baseline
- **Agent**: DiffAnalysisAgent
- **Summary**: Document differences found in gammas patch scripts relative to baseline to aid future merges.

### Scope & Context
- Affects only documentation.
- Inputs: `docs/runtime_vs_gamma_walo.md` diffs for gammas patch files.
- Output: updated `docs/conflict_summary.md` with bullet list for each file.

### Dependencies
- None.

### Data Flow Analysis
- Review diff lines for each gammas patch file.
- Summarize unique changes vs baseline.
- Added note for `ui_mm_faction_select.script` whitespace-only changes.

### Failure Cases
- Overlooking small diff lines could miss subtle modifications.

### Test Plan
- Verify updated doc lists all four patch scripts.

### Rollback & Risk
- Low; doc update only.

### Implementation Notes
Added bullet for `ui_mm_faction_select.script` noting no functional differences.

## Prescope: Plan merge strategy per file
- **Task ID**: WALO port - Plan merge strategy per file
- **Agent**: DiffAnalysisAgent
- **Summary**: Outline per-file approach for integrating features from `old_walo` and `gammas patch` into `gamma_walo`.

### Scope & Context
- Documentation only, no code changes yet.
- Inputs: `docs/conflict_summary.md` and original diff reports.
- Output: `docs/walo_merge_strategy.md` listing the merge approach for every conflicting script.

### Dependencies
- None. All diff data already generated.

### Data Flow Analysis
- **Input**: diff summaries -> analysis -> strategy table.
- **Output**: merge strategy document.
- **Downstream consumers**: future implementation subtasks for each file.

### Failure Cases
- Missing a file could lead to later confusion.
- Over-general strategy might not clarify merge steps.

### Test Plan
- Review the new doc to ensure each script from the conflict summary is covered with planned actions.

### Rollback & Risk
- Low risk. Delete or amend the doc if strategy proves incorrect.

### Implementation Notes
Will create new Markdown file summarizing planned approach for every `old_walo` and `gammas patch` script. This completes the planning stage before actual code merges.

## Prescope: Port dialogs.script helper and important_docs table
- **Task ID**: WALO port â€“ Port dialogs.script helper and important_docs table
- **Agent**: ResourceInfrastructureAgent (assuming generic dev agent)
- **Summary**: Integrate `warfare_disabled` dialog helper and the `important_docs` reward table from old WALO. Ensures tasks and document rewards behave as expected in warfare mode.

### Scope & Context
- Affected file: `gamma_walo/gamedata/scripts/dialogs.script`
- Engine hooks: dialog conditions via `warfare_disabled`; trade reward functions.

### Dependencies
- None. This file is independent of other WALO merges.

### Data Flow Analysis
- Input: dialog preconditions call `warfare_disabled`; trade functions reference `important_docs` table.
- Output: returns boolean for dialog options; reward values for documents.
- Downstream: quest dialogs and trade interactions.

### Failure Cases
- Missing table entries could break main storyline rewards.
- Incorrect helper logic may hide dialog options incorrectly.

### Test Plan
- Unit test: call `warfare_disabled` with `_G.WARFARE` both true and false.
- Unit test: ensure `important_docs` contains expected keys.

### Rollback & Risk
- Low risk: revert file if issues arise.


## Implementation: Port dialogs.script helper and important_docs table
- Added detailed comments for `warfare_disabled` helper.
- Restored important document reward values from old WALO.
- Created Busted tests covering helper logic and table presence.

## Prescope: Apply spawn chance formulas
- **Task ID**: agent_prio - Apply spawn chance formulas to faction_expansions.script
- **Agent**: ResourceInfrastructureAgent? Wait we are implementing integration of WALO features - which agent is responsible? According to agents.md, there is ResourceInfrastructureAgent for resource system, LogisticsAgent etc. For WALO port tasks, maybe DiffAnalysisAgent or other? No, not defined. We'll treat as DiffAnalysisAgent or general. But the tasks from 'Integration of Existing Mods' may not have dedicated agent. We'll pick DiffAnalysisAgent or some new 'Migration' agent. But we can just mention Myself as DiffAnalysisAgent since we are porting. Let's choose 'DiffAnalysisAgent'.
- **Summary**: Ensure WALO's simplified squad spawn chance formulas are present and tested.
### Scope & Context
- Affects `gamma_walo/gamedata/scripts/faction_expansions.script`.
- Functions: `get_advanced_chance`, `get_veteran_chance`.
- Hooks: Called by squad spawn logic via `smart_terrain_warfare.script` and `warfare_factions.script`.
### Dependencies
- None blocking; formulas already exist in baseline.
### Data Flow
- Inputs: `resource` count per faction; global `warfare.resource_count`.
- Output: numeric chance used by spawn selection.
- Consumers: faction and smart terrain spawn routines.
### Failure Cases
- Incorrect formulas could skew faction balance.
- Missing global `warfare` table may cause errors during tests.
### Test Plan
- Unit tests to compute chance at 0 and maximum resources.
- Verify veteran chance scales quadratically.
### Rollback & Risk
- Low risk; formulas unchanged from baseline. Tests ensure correctness.

## Implementation: Apply spawn chance formulas
- Confirmed formulas already matched old WALO version.
- Added `faction_expansions_spec.lua` tests verifying `get_advanced_chance` and `get_veteran_chance` outputs.

### Task: Optimize relation loops in game_relations.script
- Dependencies: gamma_walo/gamedata/scripts/game_relations.script, old walo version for reference, relation_registry engine API
- Hooks: functions called by NPC death callbacks via online_npc_on_death/offline_npc_on_death and game load via on_game_load
- Predicted breakage: Mistyped indices may crash relation checks during gameplay

- Ported blacklist loop optimisations from old WALO into game_relations.script and verified with new busted specs.
