; == Utjan's Item UI Improvments - Weapon Icon Scaling module ==
; This config is used to record the empty pixels on the right side of silencer icons. 
; This is to better scale and align silenced guns without ending up with too much empty space in the icon.
; If you're using a silencer that is not recorded here simply add it by it's section name and an offset by counting the empty pixels on the right side of it's icon in it's texture file
; I'd appreciate if you send me the section and offset you add for missing silencers. Preferably on Discord
