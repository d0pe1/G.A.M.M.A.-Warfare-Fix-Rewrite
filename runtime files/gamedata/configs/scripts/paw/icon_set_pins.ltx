; It's best to leave the default groups 
; alone. You can customize this if you like, 
; or even create your own--but it's better 
; to edit the Favorites group, which can be
; customized in icon_set_faves.ltx and will
; always be displayed at the top of MCM.
;
; You'll lose any changes to default sets 
; when updating/reinstalling PAW. Be sure 
; to back up any sets you customize.
