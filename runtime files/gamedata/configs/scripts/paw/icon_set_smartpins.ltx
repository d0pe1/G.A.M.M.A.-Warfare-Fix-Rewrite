[smartpins_icons]
; This icon set MUST exist or bad things 
; will probably happen if you try to use
; the autotag/smart pin feature.
; 
; You can customize this if you like, or 
; even create your own--but it's better 
; to edit the Favorites group, which can be
; customized in icon_set_faves.ltx and will
; always be displayed at the top of MCM.
;
; You'll lose any changes to default sets 
; when updating/reinstalling PAW. Be sure 
; to back up any sets you customize.
