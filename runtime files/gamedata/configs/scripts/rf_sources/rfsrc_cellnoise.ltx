; The first time a stalker comes into range while
; the player has the RF Receiver out, NERFS will 
; assign their PDA a frequency by picking one of 
; the comma-separated bands listed in freq, then
; randomizing it +/- 1 to N, where N is the value
; above in variance.

; Variance has no effect on any other signal.
