use_hazard_coef_avg 	= true 	; Hazard coef is the average of origin and destination rather than the greater of the two
guides_ignore_status 	= true 	; Guides ignore wounded and overweight status for fast travel
gate_northern_travel 	= true 	; North-south routes are blocked in story mode while Brain Scorcher/MM are still active

nice_round_numbers		= true 	; Generated fares will be rounded to the nearest 100RU
show_dist_and_dur 		= true 	; Show distance and duration on the context menu line
progressive_cost 		= true 	; Costs increase gradually as player ranks up
zones_use_disguises 	= false ; Disguised players ignore travel zone faction restrictions
use_vanilla_calcs		= false	; Use vanilla Anomaly's terrible distance formula instead of FFT's
use_disguise_fix 		= true	; Use FFT's fix for disguises getting exposed when you fast travel
allow_debug_travel 		= false ; When debug mode is enabled, any mapspot is a valid destination
shared_ft_cooldown		= false ; Triggering a cooldown for one travel type puts them all on cooldown
allow_open_bp 			= false ; Re-enables vanilla feature of opening backpacks from anywhere on the map
use_warfare_fix 		= false ; Fix for WAO compatibility, skips adding fast travel icons to map

prog_rank_cap 			= 56000	; Rank cap for progressive cost increase
guide_npc_cost_coef		= 2 	; Base cost multiplier for progressive cost feature
prog_coef_max			= 3		; Cost multiplier when rank is at cap
campfire_origin_dist 	= 25 	; 5m, since the function uses distance_to_sqr
minimum_health		 	= 0 	; Minimum health to travel (0 disables)
minimum_satiety 		= 0 	; Minimum satiety to travel (0 disables)
squad_tp_bind 			= -1 	; Default keybind for squad teleport (-1 is unbound)
