		%c[pda_green]Information\n
		%c[ui_gray_2]Some people come to the Zone to atone for past mistakes, to seek enlightenment or find adventure. Bandits are not those people. Formerly nothing but disparate gangs pursuing independent goals, Sultan's iron fist has forced a semblance of cohesion out of the Zone's outcasts and criminals.\n \n
		While most Bandits openly engage in turf wars with the other factions, smarter criminals opt to instead infiltrate those factions to con, kidnap, coerce and corrupt others with relative impunity. Here, the law is what you make it, and Sultan likes to see the Bandits as a law unto themselves.\n \n

		<text>%c[pda_white]Clear Sky %c[ui_gray_2]are a scientific faction dedicated to learning about the Zone's inner workings.\n \n
		%c[pda_green]Information\n
		%c[ui_gray_2]Despite their role in the 2011 Faction Wars, they are generally seen as a peaceful faction, preferring to invest their time and energy into research rather than playing at politics or war.\n
		They view the Zone and its creation as both a gift and a curse - an incredible event with unappreciated potential - and a threat to humanity if not properly kept in balance. It was this latter part of their ideology which led them to near destruction.\n \n
		Believing that a man named Strelok was upsetting the Zone's balance by trying to break into the CNPP, Clear Sky mobilized one of the largest armies ever seen in the Zone to apprehend him. They intercepted him just outside the CNPP, shortly before the third large emission. No one is completely sure what happened next, only that Clear Sky was left leaderless and decimated, while the Monolith defending the area seemed to have only gotten stronger.\n \n
		Today, however, the faction has rebuilt and recovered. This is, in large part, thanks to their new leader, Cold. Clear Sky now spends its time carrying on the research of its predecessors, ensconced in the quiet corners of the Zone.\n \n

		%c[pda_green]Information\n
		%c[ui_gray_2]With most of their best men and command staff either dead or defected, Voronin and Petrenko have been hard pressed to maintain the faction's characteristic discipline amongst the remains. Against all odds, however, the faction continues to live by its ideals, doing everything it can to keep Rostok a safe haven for neutral stalkers everywhere.\n \n
		Members who aren't part of Rostok's defense force tend to dedicate themselves to hunting down Bandits, purging mutant lairs and assisting Ecologists through donating scientific samples.\n \n
		Despite being a shadow of its former self, Duty still continues to oppose Freedom on ideological grounds, believing the Zone is too dangerous to be accessed unregulated.\n \n

		%c[ui_gray_2]There is no ecosystem anywhere else quite like the one found in the Zone, so naturally the government takes a great interest in it. It is for this reason that this faction exists - to study the artefacts, anomalies, mutants and other unnatural objects that can only be found here.\n \n
		Thus far they have established two research labs, one in Yantar and the other in Jupiter, from which they conduct most of their secretive experiments. When working out in the field they are often accompanied by an escort, usually former mercenaries, stalkers and soldiers under their employment, or are otherwise armed themselves.\n \n
		Many stalkers who hunt for artefacts and rare mutant parts sell them to the Ecologists, as they are usually willing to pay much more than anybody else for them.\n \n

		%c[ui_gray_2]Members of this faction believe in coexistence with the Zone, seeing it as both a scientific and socio-political marvel. They believe the Zone should be recognized as a free territory without rulers, and oppose anyone who seeks to control it or work against its nature. These views put them in direct contrast with Duty, who see any form of coexistence with the Zone as naive or temporary at best, and at worst advocate its destruction entirely.\n \n
		Lukash's resolve in defending against the Monolith, combined with Loki's level-headedness toward other groups has made Freedom one of the most widely accepted factions in the Zone.\n \n

		%c[ui_gray_2]Stalkers come to the Zone for a variety of reasons: a thirst for adventure, the urge to explore the unknown, or the desire to start a new life from scratch. Many influential factions take a neutral or friendly stance towards them, seeing them as potential recruits, or as workers to perform jobs they are unable or unwilling to do themselves.\n
		Most of their income is from the collection of artefacts, mutant parts, weapons and miscellaneous items discovered when looting abandoned buildings and deceased stalkers. However, almost every hopeful stalker dreams of one day finding the legendary Wish Granter - apparently an ancient alien crystal capable of fulfilling any desire.\n \n

		Contrary to popular belief, they are not just hired killers, but carry out various contracts which involve finding rare artefacts and equipment, and escorting valuable cargo through the most dangerous areas of the Zone.\n \n

		%c[pda_green]Information\n
		%c[ui_gray_2]Tasked primarily with ensuring that the border between the Zone and the outside world is not breached, they are hated here by almost everybody barring the Ecologists - who are funded by the same government - and Duty, who are rumored to have made special deals with Military command through the Spetsnaz.\n \n
		Officially, military policy in the Zone requires any known trespassers or unsanctioned inhabitants to be apprehended, not killed. In practice, however, the conscripts are given standing orders to shoot stalkers on sight, and are generally taught to regard such illegals as little better than animals. Meanwhile, their commissioned officers are frequently and easily bribed, with the most obvious example being how they generally ignore the rookie village in Cordon despite it being less than a few hundred meters away from a major checkpoint.\n \n

		%c[ui_gray_2]Fixated by their fanaticism, they attempt to resist all who would try to penetrate through to the center of the Zone - to such an extent that most stalkers consider them to be genuinely insane.\n \n
		Whilst physically on par with any other stalker in the Zone, their fervor is what truly sets them aside - members have been known to charge with knives after running out of ammo, or detonate themselves when at risk of being captured. Their members are thought to be inducted through brainwashing, previously via the use of the Brain Scorcher until it was shut down by Strelok. Irrespective of this, in recent years the Monolith have managed to obtain a seemingly endless supply of recruits and materiel.\n \n

		Their founders are rumoured to be former death row inmates secretly experimented upon in underground labs long before the Zone's creation. On the other hand, their ranks are believed to have been bolstered with outcasts, renegades, voluntary recruits, and captives that were brainwashed and mutated to serve as Sin's devoted servants.\n \n

		%c[pda_green]Information\n
		%c[ui_gray_2]While the original ISG was disbanded shortly after its founding in 2011 due to unforeseen circumstances, recent disturbing rumors followed by a vast yet harmless emission seen as far as London convinced the United Nations to restore this international group with a mandate to research the Zone.\n \n Ostensibly, they continue their old mission statement as the Western counterpart to the Ecologists, studying the Zone's wonders for the benefit of science. In reality, they are suspected by the Ukrainian government to have an avid and politically motivated interest in the Zone's true origins. Needless to say, the SSU would not want such knowledge to fall into the wrong hands. It is for this reason that officially permitted UN presence in the Zone is extremely limited.\n  \n
		Thus, the many covert UNISG members active in the Zone would do anything to preserve their secrecy while it lasts, up to and including the liquidation of potential eye witnesses. Whatever their actual goal may be, their agents in the field are now far from defenceless, and they are prepared to 'obtain knowledge' with state-of-the-art weaponry and modern combat tactics.\n \n
