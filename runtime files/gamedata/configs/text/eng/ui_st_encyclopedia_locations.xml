		%c[pda_green]Information\n
		%c[ui_gray_2]Although nothing is publicly known about the history of this hospital, it is safe to presume its intended purpose was to serve the residents of nearby Limansk. One of the location's most interesting features is the fact that it has somehow collapsed into the ground, as earthquakes in this part of the world are extremely uncommon and are usually so small that they go unnoticed.\n \n
		It is also the only major area within the Zone known to be absent of any radioactive or anomalous activity, however it is still dangerous for most stalkers due to being a common meeting ground for all sorts of Zone-worshipping cultists.\n \n

		%c[pda_white]• %c[ui_gray_2]This is one of the few locations in the Zone that Emissions and Psy-storms cannot touch.\n
		%c[pda_white]• %c[ui_gray_2]This location used to be one of the most heavily fortified places in the Zone, with machine guns and helicopters setting up kill zones along the hospital's narrow walkways.\n
		%c[pda_white]• %c[ui_gray_2]While almost none of the fortifications remain, it is speculated the hospital has since become an auxiliary temple for Monolith forces.

		%c[ui_gray_2]The other, even more remote part of Pripyat. The mutant population here is strong and especially deadly.

		%c[pda_green]Information\n
		%c[ui_gray_2]A dark echo of the smaller and safer "Garbage" area to the south-west, the Truck Cemetery is a dumping site for vehicles that have been used in extensive radiological cleanup operations following the 1986 disaster.\n \n
		Whilst most of the equipment rotting here was in perfect working order all those decades ago, it had no practical way of being decontaminated. Other equipment had simply broken down entirely. Either way, the heroic machines that mitigated the Chernobyl disaster were all left here to die.\n \n
		However, since the Zone's ultimate inception in 2006, this area has bustled into life. Sometimes, it's the site of spates between factions. Usually, it's a breeding ground for mutants. Despite being so isolated and difficult to get to, many stalkers have noticed the vehicles here are gradually being stripped bare, with many believing that somebody, perhaps the military, is attempting to salvage the metals and illegally sell them for scrap.\n \n
