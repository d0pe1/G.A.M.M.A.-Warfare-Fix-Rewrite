		%c[pda_green]Information\n
		%c[ui_gray_2]Several generations of the dog species have lived and died since the catastrophe. Each was more affected by the Zone than the previous. Rapid mutation lead to a vast improvement in previously peripheral abilities, frequently at the expense of primary ones. The most notable biological change was the loss of sight, paired with an uncanny development of smell. As it turned out, blind cubs survived in the Zone as well as normal ones, if not better. As a result, the common dog quickly became extinct in the Zone, giving way to a new breed. The animals instinctively identify and avoid anomalies, radiation and other invisible dangers that plague the Zone. Like their wild wolf ancestors, blind dogs hunt in packs. An encounter with a large group of these animals can be dangerous even to an experienced and well-armed stalker.\n \n

		%c[ui_gray_2]Experienced stalkers describe this semi-legendary beast as a tall, hunched humanoid with a mess of tentacles where its mouth should be.

However, the most astounding feature of the Bloodsucker is its ability to become invisible. Countless dead or missing stalkers are said to have perished in the merciless grip of a Bloodsucker. The lucky few who have survived an encounter tell spine-chilling tales of marshes and subterranean areas haunted by the Zone's version of Count Dracula.\n \n

		%c[pda_green]Information\n
		%c[ui_gray_2]These ugly yellowish pygmies are another mutant of possible human origin and an example of how the Zone is capable of altering the DNA of all living organisms, twisting them into nightmarish creations. These mutants inhabit underground tunnels and catacombs, as their sensitive eyes are too sensitive to daylight. They've been known to set up elaborate ambushes which strike any stalkers or science teams that delve into their shelter. Their usual tactic is to lie in wait as prey enters their area, after which they will quietly block all exits with large pieces of garbage, debris and concrete fractions thanks to their telekinetic abilities. Killed victims are torn to pieces by the dwarves' strong hands and then devoured. Interactions with other mutants are mostly peaceful, although blind dogs attack them without mercy. Burers posses a genuine intellect, and their vile character and nervous spite lead them to sometimes perform unexpected and savage deeds. Burers seem to telepathically sense nearby life forms and are able to determine their disposition without any visual contact. For this reason it is impossible to get in close proximity with a Burer without them already being aware of your presence. Their telekinesis allows them to distantly manipulate large objects, hurling them at their opponents at high speeds. They can also inflict powerful telekinetic blows directly on the victim and are even able to create telekinetic shields to stop bullets or pull a stalker's weapon from their hands. Burers are some of the the most dangerous mutants in the dark areas of the Zone.\n \n

		<text>%c[pda_white]Cats %c[ui_gray_2]in the Zone are heavily mutated local wildcats.\n \n
		%c[pda_green]Information\n
		%c[ui_gray_2]Much like many of the Zone's dogs, these mutants are remnants of regular house cats which were unfortunate enough to have survived the second disaster and replicated in the Zone long enough to become terribly mutated. Unlike dogs, which attack in packs, cats for the most part remain solitary and will hunt as single individuals. They are extremely stealthy and their claws and teeth have become elongated and exceptionally sharp. They are very aggressive and will now actively hunt humans as potential prey. Unlike dogs, which directly attack stalkers in large groups, a single cat will very quietly stalk its prey and attack from behind without making a sound. For this reason, it is arguable that a single Zone cat may be more dangerous than a pack of dogs. A popular campfire rumor states that some veteran stalkers have been lured by voices of others pleading for help from within deep foliage, only to be attacked by a cat leaping out of the shrubbery. So far, any proof for these cats being able to imitate human voices remains unproven.\n \n

		%c[ui_gray_2]The result of horrible genetic mutation on an unidentified organism? Perhaps a victim of cruel experimentation? The origin of this beast remains unknown. Adult specimens can reach up to 1.4 meters in length. A highly intelligent, strong and swift beast whose attacks and predatory habits resemble that of a tiger. Prefers to remain in concealment and strike victims from the back without a single sound. Doubled essential organs and vital systems lead to extreme levels of endurance with the beast able to survive wounds normally fatal otherwise. This is additionally amplified by extraordinary regenerative abilities. Their only worthy natural opponents in the Zone are Chernobyl dogs and Pseudogiants.\n \n

		%c[ui_gray_2]A rare humanoid mutant more commonly seen near the center of the Zone. Bears a superficial resemblance to a human with a disproportionately large head and diseased looking skin. Possesses a good level of intelligence and perception and has the ability to control the behavior of less developed creatures. Mature specimens are reportedly capable of taking control over the human mind. This may lead to the destruction of higher cognition, reducing the victim into a vegetative or zombified state or in more complex cases, may influence the victim to commit suicide. This is a ferocious enemy and even the most experienced stalkers are afraid of meeting it. Veterans warn that Controllers prefer to lay in wait and allow you to approach before striking though it is possible to sense the telepathic probing of a Controller if it is nearby, giving advanced warning of its presence.\n \n

It seems the genes responsible for metabolism were especially affected in this case. Mutant pigs, known simply as "Flesh" among the stalkers, are one of the most vivid examples of the Zone's disastrous perversion of nature. Mutant pigs developed a protective layer of scales and exoskeletal plates. Their regeneration potential increased several times, as did the complexity of their nervous system. Just like a normal pig, a Flesh is an omnivore and may attack a stalker if hungry.\n \n

		%c[pda_green]Information\n
		%c[ui_gray_2]After people abandoned the exclusion Zone during the first incident, rats flourished in number and continue to thrive in the Zone. They are expert survivors and instinctively avoid anomalies and emissions. Their main habitats are sewage headers, tunnels and basements. These animals seldom leave the underground, and will aggressively attack in swarms if threatened. The Zone did not influence their phenotype, although they now posses an increased resistance to mutation sustained from ionizing radiation.\n \n

		%c[pda_white]• Easily the most harmless mutant in the Zone, they're generally hunted for their meat, rather than the danger they pose.
		%c[pda_white]• Rats are the less aggressive and less obviously mutated cousin of the Tushkano.

		<text>%c[pda_white]Snorks %c[ui_gray_2]are horrifically mutated soldiers and stalkers.\n \n
		%c[pda_green]Information\n
		%c[ui_gray_2]It seems these creatures were human at some point, though it is difficult to imagine what conditions could turn a human being into such a disgusting beast. Snorks are insane creatures leading a beast's life and differing little from other carnivorous monsters in the Zone. They move on all fours in long jumps, constantly sniffing the ground in hope of picking up the scent of prey. They hunt carefully, in a calculated manner, frequently setting up ambushes. Thanks to its uncanny reflexes and powerful muscles, the Snork can approach a victim, pin it down in one long, accurate jump and then tear it to shreds in a matter of seconds. Strips of army uniforms and other clothing are occasionally found on their bodies so it stands to reason that they are all that's left of missing military stalkers.\n \n

		%c[pda_white]• Originally thought to be unfortunate survivors of the very first military expeditions into the Zone, their continued presence into 2018 has opened up dark avenues of thought and speculation regarding their true nature.

		%c[pda_green]Information\n
		%c[ui_gray_2]Although they bear a striking resemblance to jerboas, there is actually no link between the two. Attempts at determining the exact species from which this rodent evolved have so far been unsuccessful, although its ancestor must have been a gregarious rodent. Reaching up to 40cm at the shoulder, the animal is far more dexterous, aggressive and ravenous than its desert cousin. Mutant rodents live mainly in basements of destroyed buildings, feeding on everything they can get their teeth into, from plants to careless stalkers. Occasionally a pack of rodents will attack and kill large animals and mutants, tearing them apart before they can escape.\n \n

		%c[ui_gray_2]The Brain Scorcher strips its victim of mind and reason, leaving only an empty shell. The brainless bodies then turn into zombies, following only the most basic instincts, wandering aimlessly around the Zone without weapons or clothing. Zombies are little more than sluggish walking corpses, caring only about food and sleep. They eat and drink just about anything they can get their claws on, thus they are virtually soaked in radiation and toxic waste. Usually they roam the Zone without any apparent purpose or just lie corpse-like in abandoned buildings. However, as soon as they sense the presence, they attack immediately and some are even capable of using firearms to a very limited ability. Experienced stalkers have learned to avoid them and preserve ammo.\n \n
