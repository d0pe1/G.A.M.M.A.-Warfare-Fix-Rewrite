    <string id="st_melter_desc">
		<text>A strange and high-tech device created by Professor Sakharov. The Artefacts Melter (AM) allows the manipulation of artefact materials. This tool is fueled using the energy held by artefacts, which can be acquired and stored for further use by melting them down. The AM can also strengthen artefacts of the same kind, or even fuse artefacts of different kinds to generate new ones. The chemical and physical processes at work are not fully understood yet, though recent research points towards the tool's ability to harness the Noosphere's power. These findings quickly prompted most high ranked stalkers to acquire such a tool in order to create stronger and more expensive artefacts for the black market or their own personal use.\n \n
		%c[0,255,255,255]PROPERTIES:\n
		%c[d_cyan] • %c[0,255,255,255] Artefact Melting:%c[ui_gray_2] Hold the secure key (Left-ALT) and move the Artefact Melter over any artefact to melt it and refill the AM tank. The more unique the artefact, the more power will be stored.\n
		%c[d_cyan] • %c[0,255,255,255] Artefact Empowering:%c[ui_gray_2] Choose "Empower artifacts" in the AMOS main menu to combine artefacts of the same kind to strengthen them.\n
		%c[d_cyan] • %c[0,255,255,255] Artefact Fusion:%c[ui_gray_2] Choose "fuse artifacts" in the AMOS main menu and open the recipe sub-menu to generate a new artefact from 2 or more artefacts. The resulting artefact will have the average condition of its components. AMOS contains already known and "secure" artefact combinations.\n
		%c[d_cyan] • %c[0,255,255,255] Note: %c[ui_gray_2]AMOS has built-in security protocols to avoid malfunctions. If the tool refuses to work, be sure that the AM tank holds more than 10% (1 use) of its total capacity.\n \n

		<text>This anomalous activity detector is an updated version of the Bear detector and is able to detect all known artefacts signatures just like the Svarog or Veles detectors. This upgraded Bear detector is especially appreciated by stalkers hunting artefacts during the night as its simple display is compatible with night vision googles.\n \n
