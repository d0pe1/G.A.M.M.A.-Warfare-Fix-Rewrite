		<text>A pocket-sized electronic device designed to cover the most essential functions of a computer, the PDA is crucial for day-to-day information sharing. It comes pre-installed with a GPS module, providing geolocation and time data to the user. This upgraded version has been significantly enhanced to detect and process the locations of other modules connected to the network, making it highly sought after among stalkers. Unlike standard GPS modules, this one uses a set of codes to unlock special privileges and access additional information from the connected network. This particular device also comes with a pirated version of the IMI KilTrak software.\n \n
