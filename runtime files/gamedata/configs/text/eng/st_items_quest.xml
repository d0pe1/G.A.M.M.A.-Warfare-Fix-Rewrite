		<text>Some notes about old men's conspiracy theories.\n \n
		There are rumors that the Agroprom Institute was used as a front for an unofficial lab in the years preceding the 2006 accident. This lab hosted a number of very unusual experiments. The traders have dug up a lot of information about these laboratories.\n
		I met with the Barkeep. He says he sent Duty scouts to get into the underground vaults of the Dark Valley, called X-18, but they disappeared. There are other rumors regarding a 'psi-brain' mechanism. The whole neighborhood in Yantar is under the influence of that device. It zombified everyone who came within range. There is another mechanism in the Red Forest radar underground, called lab X-19. That is likely to be the Brain Scorcher.\n
		There is evidence to suggest that the presence of the Brain Scorcher intentionally blocks the road to the North, but no one knows exactly what it is. The Barkeep believes that the Brain Scorcher is man-made, and these mechanisms are not always operating at full strength. He thinks there are periods when their power is lowered to cool down the apparatus. It's time to visit all the underground laboratories in the Zone and find out what kind of secrets they are hiding. I'm too old for this shit. I wish Strelok was still around...\n \n
