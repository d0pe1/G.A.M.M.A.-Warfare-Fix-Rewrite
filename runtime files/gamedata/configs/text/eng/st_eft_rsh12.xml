		The powerful RSh-12 (Revolver Shturmovoy 12 - "Assault Revolver 12") revolver, manufactured by KBP Instrument Design Bureau, designed for use by special forces. Despite the powerful 12.7x55 mm caliber, RSh-12 has less recoil than many other large-caliber revolvers and pistols, since the shot is fired from the bottom chamber of the cylinder. \n \n
