		<text>The aim of the FN F2000 was to produce a modular weapon offering all of the popular features of the modern assault rifle such as a compact bullpup layout, an ambidextrous frame and a design with plenty of available options and addons. So far, the FN F2000 rifle has found only a few buyers, including the Armed Forces of Slovenia and Belgian Special Operations Forces. Regardless, it is in no doubt a unique and futuristic-looking weapon, looking like something straight out of a sci-fi movie.\n \n
