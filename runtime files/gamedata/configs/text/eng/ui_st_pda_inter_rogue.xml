		<text> - W/A/S/D to move and rotate \n 
		- Q to wait, R to shoot in direction \n 
		- To complete the level you have to reach the exit \n
		- After every 5 levels you will visit trader and can upgrade some of your attributes for money \n 
		- Money is earned mainly from getting an artefact, small amount is gained from completing level or killing mutants \n 
		- Each level will contain 1 artefact, 1 medkit (restores 4 health) and 1 ammo (restores 6 ammo) \n 
		- Every 10 levels the difficulty will increase, maps will become more narrow, more anomalies and stronger mutants will spawn \n 
		- Bloodsucker mutant is invisible and appears only when near a few cells from player \n 
		- Chimera mutant can jump at player if no walls/objects on a way \n 
		- You can shoot through obstacles that aren't wall, such as water for example (chimera can jump over them too)</text>
