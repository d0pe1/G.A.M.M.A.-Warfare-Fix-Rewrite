		<text>A gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol known for chambering the largest cartridge of any magazine-fed, self-loading pistol. It uses a gas-operated ejection/chambering mechanism normally only found in rifles, allowing it to use far more powerful cartridges than traditional semi-automatic pistol designs. This allows the Desert Eagle to compete in an area that had previously been dominated by Magnum revolvers. Oddly, this model has been customized to fire .357 magnum.\n \n
