			\n \n"...he said the stash would be chirping on 145 Mhz, but there was nothing. The weirdest thing happened, though. I started picking up interference on the RF receiver--once it even sounded like a voice, or tones, but nothing clear.\n \n
			Not long after that, I started getting headaches, blurry vision, whispers, loss of color--all the usual signs that a controller is somewhere real close. And sure enough, for once I caught sight of that bastard before he saw me.\n \n
			And that RF noise? That part I didn't hallucinate, it cut off as soon as the thing's head exploded."\n

			\n \n"...told us we'd pick up the signal on 219 Mhz, but there was nothing. Then all of a sudden I started picking up interference on the RF receiver--once it even sounded like a voice, or tones, but nothing came through clear.\n \n
			Not long after that, I started getting this weird ringing sound in my head and a blue tinge to my vision, shit started floating around--remember the last time that happened? It was another poltergeist, and I noped right out of there as soon as I saw it.\n \n
			And that RF noise? Soon as I got a couple hundred meters from the building, it just stopped."\n

			\n \n"...and there was nothing like what they said on 106 Mhz. Instead, I started getting all kinds of interference on my RF receiver--once it even sounded like a voice, or tones, but nothing I could make out.\n \n
			But get this, remember when we ran into that burer up north? It was the same deal, with the weird vision tint and hallucinations, shit flying through the air. Only saw it once, but we got the hell out of there before it could spot us.\n \n
			But that RF noise? Dropped off once we got far enough away, maybe a few hundred meters. Never heard anything like that on the scanner before, but the early warning probably saved us."\n

			There was a goddamn psydog, that close to camp--can you believe that shit? Right away we both got headaches, blurry vision, and started shooting at phantom dogs that weren't really there.\n \n
			But get this--anytime one of the phantoms got close, my RF receiver started going nuts with interference. Vanya's, though? Only squealed once, when the real thing jumped at him. Poor Vanya."\n
