He's probably being kept under watch so he can't afford to do anything besides playing along but they may decide to get rid of him without waiting for proof so we need to pull him out. We've located him nearby but he's with other stalkers. You need to kill them and escort him back. You'll recognize him by his rifle; an SVD.

So while he holds their feet to the fire, I'm authorized to reward anyone who happens to find rudimentary tools while out on patrol. So, will you keep an eye open for some?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_smart_terrain_1_6_army_mechanic_stalker_task_1_fetch_about">

		<text>HQ nearly has a full complement of tools now. However, some of the less orthodox gear, the kind used by our military stalkers, will require even more advanced tools to get the most out of them.

		<text>Maybe when I show this to the Colonel, he'll finally crack a smile. The stalkers won't know what hit them when the time comes. If you find any more tools, be sure to visit our checkpoint in Cordon or the mobile lab in Yantar. Last I heard, the technicians there require more tools themselves.</text>

		<text>There is. While I can treat the men at base just fine, my ability to keep them supplied while they're out in the field is limited. So, I've been trying to requisition a %s. It'll let me prepare medicine for almost any potential threat or injury a soldier could encounter while out on patrol.\n \n
		Or at least, it would, but my request keeps getting postponed. Every second could save a life, so my proposition is this: if you find a decent kit, I'll pay you out of my own wallet for it, no fuss. Just bring one to me as soon as you can. </text>
