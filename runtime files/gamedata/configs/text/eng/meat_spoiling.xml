		<text>Foul-smelling and decayed raw meat that was not cooked in time. Consuming it would be a death sentence, as it's teeming with bacteria and toxic Zone contaminants. Not even dogs would eat this anymore.\n \n

	<string id="st_rotten_meat_cooked_descr">
		<text>Once a hearty zone-produced meal, this bowl of mush has long since turned rancid, its surface slick with grease and speckled with mold. The stench alone is enough to make a seasoned stalker gag. Eating it would be a death wish, as whatever lurks within is sure to bring agony, if not something far worse.\n \n

	<string id="st_rotten_meat_snork_descr">
		<text>Severed from a long-dead Snork, this putrid limb is riddled with infection and oozing foul fluids. The tendons and bones are a grotesque reminder of the mutant’s tortured existence. Even traders refuse to touch it, as it serves no purpose other than to spread disease.\n \n
