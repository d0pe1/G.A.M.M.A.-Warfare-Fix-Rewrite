		<text>The American equivalent of the polymer-frame, striker-fired HS2000 manufactured by HS Produkt. The Mod.2 model is a much smaller version of the HS2000, meant to be used for concealed carry, with the notable significant change being the "Grip Zone" offering incredible ergonomic improvements. Despite being a small pistol with a low magazine capacity, it's a welcome addition for those that need an accurate pistol with minimal recoil.\n \n
