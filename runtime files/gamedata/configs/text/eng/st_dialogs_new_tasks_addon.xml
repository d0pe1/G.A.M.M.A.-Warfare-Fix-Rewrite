		<text>Snitch told me to meet you. You know something that could shed some light on the "fiery" stalker from the rumors, right?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="baraholka_trader_the_living_fire_1_1">
		<text>Ah, yes... I've got something, but don't get your hopes too high. Some time ago we've observed weird flashes happening at night behind the huge garbage pile south of us, followed by some terrifying howling of mutants. Some loners were curious what's happened there and visited the place during the day. They've found some dead fleshes there which were... well.. slightly grilled. At first we thought that those fleshes got into some hardly visible anomaly that disappeared the next day or encountered a flame poltergeist, but there was one peculiar thing about one of them. It had something that looked like a brand on its back - it was in the shape of a human hand. It could have been a simple accident... or not? Who knows...\n \nYou could have a look around here at night if you'd like to find out more. If that guy really exists, then his affinity with fire might be a good clue where you should look for him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="baraholka_trader_the_living_fire_1_2">
		<text>Hmm... this still sounds like some veteran story to scare rookies. Either way, I'll try to find out something more. Thanks.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="baraholka_trader_the_living_fire_1_3">
		<text>Yeah... I've got to admit it sounds nuts. You should still watch your back. The Zone is a strange place...\nAnyway - Snitch owes me one round for this, no matter what's the outcome of your investigation.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="baraholka_trader_the_living_fire_2_0">
		<text>I'm back from my sear...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="baraholka_trader_the_living_fire_2_1">
		<text>Let me guess. You've just wasted time chasing yet another rumor for Snitch, am I ri...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="baraholka_trader_the_living_fire_2_2">
		<text>I saw him... that stalker from the rumor.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="baraholka_trader_the_living_fire_2_3">
		<text>You saw... what? Are you serious now? Wait... you look a little pale... You're serious?! Does it have something to do with that loud explision that we heard?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="baraholka_trader_the_living_fire_2_4">
		<text>Yes. He was doing some sort of... ritual... at the Greek Fire anomaly. There was fire everywhere around. A stray flesh came close and got... evaporated?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="baraholka_trader_the_living_fire_2_5">
		<text>How the hell are you alive then, huh? Did you talk with him?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="baraholka_trader_the_living_fire_2_6">
		<text>I don't know. He has certainly been aware of my presence from the beginning, even though he didn't see me. When I wanted to ask who he is, he interrupted me saying that everyone will know his name and disappeared in a fiery explosion shortly after.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="baraholka_trader_the_living_fire_2_7">
		<text>Everyone will know his name, huh? That doesn't sound good. Well - at least Snitch will be happy to hear that you've found something. Now he definitely owes me a whole bottle.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="bar_informator_mlr_the_living_fire_2_0">
		<text>Snitch - we need to talk.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_informator_mlr_the_living_fire_2_1">
		<text>The rumor turned out to be true. I know... I've already received a message from my friend. You've done well. Here - you've earned it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_informator_mlr_the_living_fire_2_2">
		<text>Five thousands? Are you out of your mind? I could have died there!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_informator_mlr_the_living_fire_2_3">
		<text>Shhh... shut it. There's more to come. Work for me a bit more and you'll get it. We need to find out more. People won't pay much just for the information that this stalker exists. Well... maybe Petrenko will, given that he's lost two men because of him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_informator_mlr_the_living_fire_2_4">
		<text>So what's the plan now? We don't know where he went or what's his goal. We have no leads.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_informator_mlr_the_living_fire_2_5">
		<text>We do. When you've been doing your investigation, I've overheard a talk between two scientists about some abnormal anomalous activity exactly at the place where you've met the stranger. You should go and talk with Sakharov and offer your help investigating the issue.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_informator_mlr_the_living_fire_2_6">
		<text>Fine. I'll be on my way then.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_informator_mlr_the_living_fire_2_7">
		<text>Just one more thing. Don't mention to him that it was me who was eavesdropping on his colleagues. I don't want them to be more cautious around me. Scientific information tends to be pretty valuable.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_1_0">
		<text>Professor - may I have a word with you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_1_1">
		<text>Not now young man. We're busy investigating some recent incident.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_1_2">
		<text>Is that matter by any chance related to the Greek Fire anomaly?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_1_3">
		<text>How did you know? Did you intercept some message that I sent to my assistants?! This information is classified!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_1_4">
		<text>Don't get upset, professor. It's irrelevant how I did find out. The thing is - I've been there not long time ago when something weird happened and I'm willing to share my knowledge with you if you agree to disclose what you know. This would be mutually beneficial. Maybe I could assist you with...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_1_5">
		<text>Didn't I make myself clear?! This information is class... wait... You say you've seen something there? What was it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_1_6">
		<text>Knowledge for knowledge professor. I can assure you that my information is worth it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_1_7">
		<text>Damn you... so be it. Our scanners have been showing some abnormal readings from that anomaly for a few days now - sudden spikes in the energy it emitted. Just as if the anomaly was expanding and going back to its base state. We've seen fluctuations like this in other anomalies before, although not with this frequency. We've decided to ignore it. Not long time ago our readings went off scale at night for a short time before going back to normal. This is very worrying. We might be in big trouble if anomalies start to expand uncontrollably.\n \nNow please tell me, what have you seen there? I assume you've seen many anomalies in your life, so it had to be something extraordinary.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_1_8">
		<text>Yes - it was. Just like you said, the anomaly was really active at that time. It was spewing a lot of flames. What's the most interesting is that there was a man among those flames. He was performing some kind of ritual. What I found out later is that he can somehow control the fire. He literally disintegrated a flesh on my eyes. After a short time, he bursted into flames and disappeard. That's also when the flames went dormant again.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_1_9">
		<text>That's fascinating! So it was him who empowered the anomaly. Did you have a chance to talk with him?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_1_10">
		<text>No - unfortunately not... though he said that in time everyone will know his name.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_1_11">
		<text>This doesn't sound well given what power he has. We need to find out what he wants to achieve.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_1_12">
		<text>I agree and I've got to say I hoped that you could tell me where I should head next.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_1_13">
		<text>I'm afraid I can't help you with that. Our scanners didn't show anything else for... wait... there it is! The scanners are showing unnatural activity at the Fault anomaly. You should head there immediately!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_1_14">
		<text>Thank you, professor! I'll be going then.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_2_0">
		<text>Bad news, professor. I didn't manage to get there in time to meet that man.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_2_1">
		<text>I'd say it's some wonderful news. Our readings have shown a really extreme spike in the energy emitted by that anomaly. If you were closer to it, you'd probably get obliterated.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_2_2">
		<text>Oh, well... lucky me I guess...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_2_3">
		<text>I'm also glad that you've made it back in one piece. Now please tell me, how did you manage to stop the anomaly from branching?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_2_4">
		<text>Eh - branching? I just destroyed a bunch of flame poltergeists at that place. They didn't seem to be special. I've seen a few of those already.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_2_5">
		<text>They actually were very special, young man. You see - our scanners detected them as separate entities with a similar energy to other thermal anomalies, just a bit weaker. They were a sort of proto-anomalies. If you didn't stop them there, they'd turn into another big anomalous zones, given enough time.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_2_6">
		<text>Hmm... I guess that man is even more dangerous than we thought then.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_2_7">
		<text>Yes, indeed. We need to find out what his motives are as fast as possible. Unfortunately, I don't think I can help you with locating him again. Our readings went back to normal once more.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_2_8">
		<text>That's alright, professor. I'll continue the investigation on my own. Goodbye.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="bar_informator_mlr_the_living_fire_3_0">
		<text>I'm back from Yantar. Got some more news for you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_informator_mlr_the_living_fire_3_1">
		<text>That's great! But first, let me tell you something. People are actually paying some good money to learn more about The Living Fire. A catchy nickname, right? I came up with it myself, since you didn't learn his true name yet. Here's your share mate. Now - what did you learn?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_informator_mlr_the_living_fire_3_2">
		<text>Now that's better. As for my findings - the scientists indeed did notice the increase in anomalous activity on Garbage. They've also sent me to investigate another suspicious activity at the Great Swamp. I was late there and the party started before I got there, but later on I found out it was good - otherwise I'd probably not be talking with you right now. This time that man managed to somehow create some things called "proto-anomalies" by Sakharov that could later on turn into big anomalous zones. I've managed to get rid of them in time.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_informator_mlr_the_living_fire_3_3">
		<text>Woah! So we've got an impending doom where we'll all burn in hell? I smell some good money here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_informator_mlr_the_living_fire_3_4">
		<text>Wha... Are you serious? You're not worried? Even a bit?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_informator_mlr_the_living_fire_3_5">
		<text>We're all gonna die sooner or later my friend. People with money tend to die later though and it looks like our partnership will make me pretty rich soon. I'll leave the Zone just in time if anything is to happen.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_informator_mlr_the_living_fire_3_6">
		<text>Yeah... I don't share your optimism.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_informator_mlr_the_living_fire_3_7">
		<text>You don't have to. It's just a business. You're also into unveiling the mysteries of the Zone, right? So you have double gains here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_informator_mlr_the_living_fire_3_8">
		<text>Maybe you are right. Anyway - scientists didn't see any other spikes in anomalous activity yet, so we might be in a dead end right now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_informator_mlr_the_living_fire_3_9">
		<text>Not exactly - you forgot about me. Good old Petrenko dropped by recently with his walkie-talkie and so it happens that I've been nearby to hear some interesting stuff. He was talking with some officials. You see - the military squad guarding the X-18 laboratory had some unexpected guest. The last survivor has managed to send an S.O.S signal, also mentioning that his comrades were turned to ash before he also broke the connection. I'm pretty sure it was the guy we're looking for.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_informator_mlr_the_living_fire_3_10">
		<text>Right - and you expect me to chase him?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_informator_mlr_the_living_fire_3_11">
		<text>Why not? You've survived your last encounter with him, right? Maybe there's a reason for it. He might know something about you that actually saved your life. Besides - do you want to leave this mystery unsolved? Have you forgotten about the end of the world? *laughs*</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_informator_mlr_the_living_fire_3_12">
		<text>Damn you, Snitch. You should take it more seriously. I don't think I have any choice though... I'll go there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_informator_mlr_the_living_fire_3_13">
		<text>Now that's the spirit! I hope you come back with some more valuable information.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="the_living_fire_prometheus_the_living_fire_1_0">
		<text>It's not some kind of a trick, right?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="the_living_fire_prometheus_the_living_fire_1_1">
		<text>Why would it be? If I wanted to kill you, we'd not be talking right now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="the_living_fire_prometheus_the_living_fire_1_2">
		<text>Why didn't you then? I've seen your power... that flesh on the Garbage bursted into flames.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="the_living_fire_prometheus_the_living_fire_1_3">
		<text>I know you, stalker. I know that you've seen the Wish Granter and didn't make a selfish wish, like many others would. You're pure at heart. Now - I believe you have many questions.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="the_living_fire_prometheus_the_living_fire_1_4">
		<text>You're damn right. Who are you?! Why are you doing all of this... and... what exactly are you doing?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="the_living_fire_prometheus_the_living_fire_1_5">
		<text>I'm just a simple stalker - like you. I've mainly sticked to the souther parts of the Zone before a certain accident, but we'll get to it. I was going by the name of Boris... a simple newbie that came to the Zone to make some money and pay off my debts. I was mainly running some errands for the local traders... mainly for that scumbag Sidorovich.\n \nYou see - one day I've received a task to deliver some package to the scientists at Yantar. Seemd like some easy money. It didn't turn out well for me... I got captured by a squad of military and they offered to let me go free if I pay them. Once they got the money, they took everything from me and beat me up so badly that I could barely walk... fucking corrupted bastards.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="the_living_fire_prometheus_the_living_fire_1_6">
		<text>Yeah... fairness is not a trait you can find among our soldiers and officials... what happened next?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="the_living_fire_prometheus_the_living_fire_1_7">
		<text>I've managed to get to the Garbage, where I've stayed at the hangar. The Butcher took care of me for a few days and helped me heal my wounds. He knows a lot about the Zone and knows some ointment made out of some mutant fat that makes the wounds heal faster.\n \nOnce I've regained my strength, I've went back to Cordon. I wanted to get some supplies from my stash there, but guess what - some bastard stole all my stuff again.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="the_living_fire_prometheus_the_living_fire_1_8">
		<text>Tough luck, huh? Things like this happen in the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="the_living_fire_prometheus_the_living_fire_1_9">
		<text>You wouldn't expect to get robbed by your fellows though, right? I know that for a fact that it was one of my "friends" that took my stuff and went further north to avoid confronting me. With no gun and no money, I had to turn to Sidorovich for a loan. He refused, because I did not deliver my package that got taken by military. He offered me another task though - he told me to fetch some uncommon artifact that can only be found in thermal anomalies. He gave me an old PM and a pack of bullets that I had to return after my task is done. He also said that he'll place the bounty on me if I don't return to him with that artifact in three days.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="the_living_fire_prometheus_the_living_fire_1_10">
		<text>Sidor is a greedy bastard, but this is rather extreme, even for him... What did you do next?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="the_living_fire_prometheus_the_living_fire_1_11">
		<text>I couldn't refuse... There are no thermal anomalies around Cordon, so I had to go somewhere else. Darkscape and Great Swamp are very dangerous, especially if you have only a PM. I've decided to look around the Greek Fire anomaly. I've spent two days hanging around the Flea Market, eating some leftovers, avoiding the fight and visiting the anomaly once in a while. The traders there saw my misery and shared a loaf of breat with me one time.\n \nAt the third day the luck has finally smiled at me... or so I thought. The right artifact has appeared and I've been trying to reach for it without ending up as a crisp. It drifted towards me and I got it in my hands. Then, out of a sudden, a flesh jumped out of the bushes and pushed me straight into the anomaly. I felt a terrible pain all over my body and lost my conciousness shortly after. I thought that's my end... getting devoured by the flames.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="the_living_fire_prometheus_the_living_fire_1_12">
		<text>How are you still alive then?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="the_living_fire_prometheus_the_living_fire_1_13">
		<text>Patience, my friend. I woke up one day later, completely naked, surrounded by the flames that I couldn't feel... I felt a burning pain at my heart though. I was trying to gather my thoughts there when I saw some stalker approaching and aiming straight at me - it was the bounty hunter sent by Sidorovich. I've begged for mercy and reached out with my hand, but he fired anyway. His bullets didn't reach me... they've melted inside the wall of flames that appeared in front of me. That's when I understood - the Zone has granted me this new power. The bounty hunter was also shocked seeing me still alive after the flames extinguished. Before he managed to pull the trigger again, a fireball shot out of my hand straight at him, turning him into a pile of dust. The Zone has repaid me for all the suffering and humiliation. I was chosen by her.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="the_living_fire_prometheus_the_living_fire_1_14">
		<text>Eh, chosen? Do you really think this was some kind of destiny? Strange things happen in the Zone every day... it could have been a simple accident.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="the_living_fire_prometheus_the_living_fire_1_15">
		<text>That may be, but I know for sure that Boris has died that day. I've taken a new name - Prometheus.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="the_living_fire_prometheus_the_living_fire_1_16">
		<text>Prometheus? That's... poetic.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="the_living_fire_prometheus_the_living_fire_1_17">
		<text>Yes... it's a tribute to the anomaly that granted me my powers.\n \nI've spent a few more days there, learning how to use my powers properly and conciously. The day that we've met, I've ascended to a new level... I've learned how to draw energy from the anomalies and also empower them. I also felt your presence at the Great Swamp, so I guess it was you who stopped my little experiment. Then I've came here to meditate further on my powers and look who's here again. Why do you chase after me, stalker?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="the_living_fire_prometheus_the_living_fire_1_18">
		<text>I... I guess I was mainly driven by curiosity. What's your ultimate goal?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="the_living_fire_prometheus_the_living_fire_1_19">
		<text>My ultimate goal? Well - it's... *sigh*... I think we have some uninvited guests. Till next we meet, stalker - farewell.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="the_living_fire_prometheus_the_living_fire_1_20">

		<text>He turned a squad of military into crisps, so you can guess I didn't... but I had a chance to talk with him.</text>

		<text>What's the situation, professor?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_3_1">
		<text>It's good to see you, young man. The situation is very serious, so I'll be quick.\n \nWe've spotted an extreme spike in anomalous activity in the X-16 underground complex. I've never seen a thing like this. It's surely the doing of our mysterious stalker. If an energy of this magnitute turns into an actual anomalous field, this whole place is going to turn into hell!\n \nWe've sent a small group of mercenaries to investigate the place and they've met a single stalker at the entrance that opened fire on sight. The mercenaries had the numbers, so they've stormed the place. This was a mistake. They've managed to kill that stalker, but something unexpected happened soon after. They've started to rally near his body and then it suddenly exploded. Only one man from the mercenary squad has survived - his body was badly burned.</text>

		<text>These are fellow stalkers which share my vision. They've came looking for me after my friend Andrei whom I've met recently started spreading my message.

		<text>Oh - what can I do for you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_4_4">
		<text>The man that the mercenaries have killed is one of Prometheus followers. He has imbued them with his power and he's planning to use them as some kind of power relay. We'll need to use your connections with authorities.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_4_5">
		<text>I see. You want me to request the military to protect as many thermal anomalies as possible and dispose of suspicious stalkers when they come close, right?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_4_6">
		<text>Not exactly. I think Prometheus will feel it when he loses connection with his followers. We need to make him think that everything is alright. He'll try to use all this power at once, so if we dispose of all his power relays at the same time, he'll probably drain too much of his own power before he realises what happened. This might give me some window of opportunity to end his life.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_4_7">
		<text>That's a very risky plan... I don't think we have any other options though.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_4_8">
		<text>Probably not. I'll try to use some powerful weapon to increase my chance of success. The Gauss rifle should be good enough.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_4_9">
		<text>This sounds like a plan. Do you know where he is now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_4_10">
		<text>He said he'll need to visit some anomaly personally to harness its power. Do you know which anomaly he was speaking of?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_4_11">
		<text>There's one anomaly with exceptionally high energy. It's located in the Red Forest. I doubt military will agree to send some people there. It's too risky. You'll need to secure it yourself first. If it also starts branching, I hope you'll manage to stop it again.</text>

		<text>I wanted to thank you, young man. Maybe the military did aid us in stopping Prometheus, but it was you who actually investigated this issue and led it to the end, risking your own life.\n \nI'm not sure what Prometheus was doing at that moment, but he somehow managed to remotely empower the biggest anomaly in the zone that's located further north than the CNPP. If you wouldn't stop him, many people would have died. You have my gratitude.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_the_living_fire_5_2">

		<text>That may be *laughs*\n \nAnyway - you still deserve a reward. My colleagues have assisted the military near the anomalies that Prometheus visited personally. After his death, an exceptional artifact was born in the Greek Fire. I'd like you to have it. It seems to have some bad influence over my colleagues and I'd rather not have another power-crazy man emerge again.\n \nYou've survived multiple encounters with Prometheus, so he saw something in you...

		<text>In a matter of fact - yes. We're looking for some mercenaries to protect our scientific crews.

Digging through all of them would take ages.\n \nYou should probably ask some people around if they know some stories that'd give you some clues... Preferably the ones that spent a lot of time here.</text>

		<text>Hey Barkeep. You've spent a lot of time in the Zone and you've surely heard a lot of stories around here. Do you mind me asking some questions?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader_mystery_of_the_swamps_2_1">
		<text>Hah - you're interested in some drunkards' stories? Sure, ask.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader_mystery_of_the_swamps_2_2">
		<text>Do you know some story about woman that lived around here who also happened to be some kind of witch?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_visitors_barman_stalker_trader_mystery_of_the_swamps_2_3">
		<text>Well - a lot of people used to live here before, especially in Pripyat, but I haven't heard anything like this... except for the story about Baba Yaga that you've dealt with.</text>

	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_trader_mystery_of_the_swamps_1_2">
		<text>You've been sitting in this bunker for quite a while, right? Have you heard about some woman that lived around here who had some kind of psychic powers?</text>

		<text>Hey Forester. You've spent a lot of time around here, right? May I ask you some questions?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_tech_mystery_of_the_swamps_1_1">
		<text>I don't get visitors too often... not to mention the ones that would be willing to have some longer chat. What would you like to know, young man?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_tech_mystery_of_the_swamps_1_2">
		<text>I'm trying to find some information about a knowledgable woman that died some long time ago. You might not believe me, but it seems like her ghost has became restless and seeks justice.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_tech_mystery_of_the_swamps_1_3">
		<text>I believe you, my friend. I've seen many things in my life that are hard to explain. As for your question - a knowledgable woman... do you mean some kind of a whisperer... or perhaps a witch?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_tech_mystery_of_the_swamps_1_4">
		<text>Yes! That's it! Did you know a person like that?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_tech_mystery_of_the_swamps_1_5">
		<text>Yes... Very long time ago, when I was a little boy, a woman like that was living in the nearby village. You might have heard about it. It's the Kopachy village north of here.\n \nBack in the times, when this land was only beginning to heal after the war, it was hard to receive a proper medical help in remote locations like that and people often put their fate in hands of the local witches, elders or shamans. The woman you're asking about was this kind of healer. Don't get me wrong here - her knowledge was passed down through generations and she was actually able to help many people using natural remedies. She was well known around here.\n \nUnfortunately, the trust of simple-minded people goes as quickly as it comes... whenever a plague or famine hit the village, people were suspicious of the woman that stayed in good health... some even claimed that it was all her doing.\n \nPeople that feed on similar lies will sooner or later snap... and so it happened with one of the men whose young son went missing one day and was never found. The father started talking nonsense about the witch that was eating children and feasting on the sorrow of her neighbours whenever some tragedy hit the village. Am... am I not boring you with this tale?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_tech_mystery_of_the_swamps_1_6">
		<text>No! Of course not! Please, continue.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_tech_mystery_of_the_swamps_1_7">
		<text>Very well. We're getting close to the end of the story. It's hard for me to understand, but people around soon started believing the words of that madman and started turning their back at her. Each iteration of the stories told among the folks was becoming darker and darker. As the time passed, a once revered healer was by many believed to be the devil incarnate.\n \nIt took only one more tragedy to seal the fate of that woman. Another child disappeared somewhere in the woods when their parents were working and people were more willing to believe that it was her and not some pack or wolves or a bear. The angry mob came to the hut of the woman at night and even though they did not find any evidence for murder, they still found her guilty. Her pleas were for nothing. The two fathers of missing children have dragged her to the nearby swamp and drowned her there. In their words, it was a "proper punishment for a witch"...\n \nIt was a terrible, unnecessary death... To think that people can turn their back at the person that was always there to help... It makes me feel that we're worse than animals. Anyway - if its her ghost that you're trying to deal with, you can clearly see she has a reason to hate people.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_tech_mystery_of_the_swamps_1_8">
		<text>That's a very sad story... I also pity her.\n \nButcher has mentioned that there are two ways to banish the spirit - burn the bones of its body or help it with finishing the business that bounds it to this world. Given how she seems to be the victim here, do you have some idea what could be her unfinished business?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_tech_mystery_of_the_swamps_1_9">
		<text>All the people responsible for her death - be it directly or indirectly - are long time dead. The Zone is still full of the people ready to stab their friends in the back for whatever reason. Maybe her purpose is to punish people like this and in that case I doubt it you could ever help her to fulfill it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_tech_mystery_of_the_swamps_1_10">
		<text>Hmm... her spirit was accompanied by some other ghosts when I last met her. Maybe she's tormenting those souls even after death?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_tech_mystery_of_the_swamps_1_11">
		<text>Given how badly she was treated by people she helped, I wouldn't be surprised if she did. Maybe you should let her have her revenge?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_tech_mystery_of_the_swamps_1_12">
		<text>I gladly would if not for the fact that she has also tried to kill me. I'm not a bad person... or at least I think so. She also killed some scientists and my companions. How likely is it that we're all deserving this?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_tech_mystery_of_the_swamps_1_13">
		<text>Hmm... there's something to it. According to some old stories that I've heard as a child, if souls are wandering this world for too long, they become corrupted. I thought she came back only recently, but given how she attacks everybody, I'm pretty sure her sould is beyond saving.\n \nThere's no other way. You'll need to burn her bones.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_tech_mystery_of_the_swamps_1_14">
		<text>But how will I find them? You've said that she was drowned in the swamp very long time ago.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_tech_mystery_of_the_swamps_1_15">
		<text>You said that her psychic powers have persisted even after death. You should talk to the scientists. I'm almost sure they'll be able to help you locate the bones. Also it's in their best interest given how one of their bunkers stands next to Kopachy and the other one borders a huge swamp...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_tech_mystery_of_the_swamps_1_16">
		<text>Thank you, Forester. You've helped me a lot.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_tech_mystery_of_the_swamps_1_17">

		<text>Greetings, Professor. Would you spare me a minute of your time?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b6_scientist_nuclear_physicist_mystery_of_the_swamps_1_1">
		<text>Be quick, please. We're having a problem with huge plague of Karliks haunting the nearby village ruins.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b6_scientist_nuclear_physicist_mystery_of_the_swamps_1_2">
		<text>Actually that's related to the thing I need to discuss with you. Are your instruments detecting some abnormal psy field around the village?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b6_scientist_nuclear_physicist_mystery_of_the_swamps_1_3">
		<text>Huh - how did you know that?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b6_scientist_nuclear_physicist_mystery_of_the_swamps_1_4">
		<text>That's irrelevant, but let's say I know how to take care of your problem. Can you give me some more details?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b6_scientist_nuclear_physicist_mystery_of_the_swamps_1_5">
		<text>Of course! We've been detecting this weak abnormal psy field slowly building up over the past few weeks. For most of the time it was dispersed throughout the whole village region, but just recently we've been able to track the emergence of its center. It's located inside the big building that has best maintained its structure. We've been trying to send some squads to investigate that place, but as soon as someone gets close to the village, Karliks crawl out of the ground and rubble. Some of our colleagues have also reported hallucinations. Now - can you please tell me what you know?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b6_scientist_nuclear_physicist_mystery_of_the_swamps_1_6">
		<text>I'm sorry Professor, but there's no time for explanations. We'll be in big trouble if we don't act quickly. Do you have some men able to fight?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b6_scientist_nuclear_physicist_mystery_of_the_swamps_1_7">
		<text>I'm afraid I can't help you with that. We're heavily understaffed. If you say we're in danger, we can't leave the bunker unprotected.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b6_scientist_nuclear_physicist_mystery_of_the_swamps_1_8">
		<text>Understood. I'll be on my way then.</text>
