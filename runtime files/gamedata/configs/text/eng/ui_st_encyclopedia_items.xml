		<text>The %c[pda_white]Artefact Application Module (AAM) %c[ui_gray_2]is used to store artefacts and filter dangerous radiation levels, allowing its user to safely attach artefacts on their belt.\n \n
		%c[pda_green]Information\n
		%c[ui_gray_2]The Artefact Application Module (AAM) filters a significant amount of radiation particles emitted from artefacts. This advanced mechanical module is the most effective way of harnessing the power of most potent artefacts. Artefact filter is composed of numerous layers made of nano-carbon. It is hence lightweight and has strongest radiation shielding properties of all devices. Regarded as a symbol of affluence in the Zone. Most commonly used by the scientists to minimise the harmful effects of artefacts. Designed and manufactured in Ukraine by a government institute which provides equipment for the scientists residing in the Zone of Alienation. In case of emergency or if no longer needed, the module can be utilised as a source of quality metal for use in outfit or helmet repairs. Currently unusable. To attach it to the belt, you have to put an artefact inside. The artefact will retain its characteristics with the exception of reduced radiation output. Compared to the AAC, the AAM is capable of filtering out neutrons. Formed by only the most unstable artefacts, neutrons are able to penetrate skin and, in high doses, damage DNA and internal organs by causing instability to a molecule's atomic nuclei, which may then in turn decay to cause further damage. Even if the neutron is 'safely' absorbed, sufficient exposure will lead to deuterium poisoning.\n \n
