		<text>Desert Eagle "Steppe Eagle"</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_steppe_eagle_descr">
		<text>A gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol known for chambering the largest cartridge of any magazine-fed, self-loading pistol. It uses a gas-operated ejection/chambering mechanism normally only found in rifles, allowing it to use far more powerful cartridges than traditional semi-automatic pistol designs. This allows the Desert Eagle to compete in an area that had previously been dominated by Magnum revolvers. The "Steppe Eagle" features an integrated muzzle compensator for drastically reduced recoil and a heavily redesigned picatinny rail for use with a range of sights and scopes. Apparently brought to the Zone by a Stalker, fate unknown, under the guise of a journalist-photographer who managed to reach the center of Pripyat alone.\n \n
