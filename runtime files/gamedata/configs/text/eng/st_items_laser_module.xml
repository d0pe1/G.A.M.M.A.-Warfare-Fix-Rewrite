		<text>A tactical attachment that emits a focused laser beam, enhancing hip-fire accuracy and allowing for quicker target acquisition, especially in low-light environments. Favored by those who prefer fast, reactive shooting, it proves invaluable in close-quarters combat where aiming down sights is too slow. In most situations, the device can even be used along side NVGs.\n \n
