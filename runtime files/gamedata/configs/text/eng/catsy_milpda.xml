This sophisticated model was designed by an unknown entity for use by covert military or NGO operators and includes a cryptographic module enabling the user to infiltrate many of the Zone's secure private networks, revealing the approximate location of enemy squads operating in the area.\n \n

        <text>\nNormally, the game decides if you can see a squad on the map based on whether their faction is neutral to yours, allied, or an enemy. As soon as you buy a more advanced PDA, you can immediately see all the factions it supports.\n

        That's a powerful advantage, especially against enemy factions.

            \n \n%c[ui_gray_1]The %c[255,130,180,130]Milspec PDA%c[ui_gray_1] addon has multiple related purposes: \n 
            %c[ui_gray_1] • %c[pda_white]Allows detailed %c[pda_yellow]customization of squad and body mapspots%c[pda_white] supported by each tier of PDA\n
            %c[ui_gray_1] • %c[pda_white]Adds the %c[255,130,180,130]Milspec PDA%c[pda_white]: a %c[pda_yellow]tier 4 device that isn't sold or dropped%c[pda_white], and is difficult to craft\n
            %c[ui_gray_1] • %c[pda_white]Includes %c[255,130,180,130]Kill Tracker%c[pda_white]: %c[pda_yellow]customizable dead body tracking%c[pda_white] with support for PAW icons\n
            %c[ui_gray_1] • %c[255,130,180,130]Blacklist%c[pda_white] lets you %c[pda_yellow]block a faction from appearing on any PDA%c[pda_white]\n \n
            %c[ui_gray_1] • %c[pda_white]Powerful %c[255,130,180,130]Progressive Mode%c[pda_white] lets the player %c[pda_yellow]earn access to see other factions on the map\n
            
            \n%c[ui_gray_1]Every feature can be customized to your liking in the MCM menus. %c[pda_white]If you don't like how something works, check MCM first! There's probably a setting for it.\n

            \n%c[pda_white]From %c[pda_yellow]MCM > Milspec PDA%c[pda_white]:\n
            %c[pda_yellow]Settings%c[pda_white]: General settings for the Kill Tracker, UI, and the entire addon.\n
            %c[pda_yellow]Blacklist%c[pda_white]: Pick which factions will never show on any PDA.\n

            %c[pda_red]Still having difficulties? Scroll down for troubleshooting information.\n

            \n%c[pda_green]ADVANCED KILL TRACKER\n
            %c[ui_gray_1]
            The %c[pda_yellow]Kill Tracker%c[ui_gray_1] is, by default, supported by all PDAs except the original PDA 1.0. Internally, the addon is always tracking all bodies on the map at all times--but what you see depends on your preferences.\n \n

            By default, Kill Tracker will %c[pda_yellow]display map markers for all kills made by you or your squadmates%c[ui_gray_1]. That includes both stalkers and mutants. However, you won't see body markers for any kills that weren't caused by you or your crew.\n \n

            If you'd prefer to see all kills or the map, this and many other aspects of Kill Tracker are--just like everything else--%c[pda_yellow]completely configurable in MCM%c[ui_gray_1].\n 

            \n%c[pda_green]ACQUIRING THE NEW TIER 4 PDA\n
            %c[ui_gray_1]
            The %c[pda_yellow]Milspec PDA%c[ui_gray_1] has higher power requirements than PDA 3.1, but comes with the unique ability to %c[pda_yellow]see the locations of enemy squads%c[ui_gray_1] on the map.\n \n

            This is obviously very powerful, so it is recommended that you balance this power with this addon's %c[pda_yellow]Progressive Mode%c[ui_gray_1], which is described in more detail below.\n \n

            The new PDA cannot be bought anywhere, and no stalker will ever drop it. By default, you must craft it using %c[pda_yellow]Expert Tools%c[ui_gray_1].

            This requires that you have found and read the correct volume of the %c[pda_yellow]Engineering manual%c[ui_gray_1], and also requires certain %c[pda_yellow]rare components%c[ui_gray_1].\n \n

            You can change these requirements in the script or config files if you're adept at that. If you're not, and you can't be bothered to earn the Milspec PDA the hard way, there's always the debug console. I don't judge.\n 

            \n%c[pda_green]PROGRESSIVE MODE\n
            %c[ui_gray_1]When you enable Milspec PDA's %c[pda_yellow]Progressive Mode%c[ui_gray_1], simply buying or crafting a more advanced PDA does not automatically let you see all of the factions it normally would. Instead, you must earn that access--whether temporarily or permanently--by looting PDAs from dead stalkers.\n \n

            By %c[pda_yellow]looting enough of a faction's PDAs%c[ui_gray_1], you will gain data that lets you infiltrate their faction's wireless network--giving you the ability to %c[pda_yellow]see their squads on the map%c[ui_gray_1]. Most factions will eventually figure out what's happened, and %c[pda_yellow]change their access codes%c[ui_gray_1] after a time--so take advantage of it while you can.\n \n

            Progressive Mode is %c[pda_yellow]very powerful, and configurable to your liking%c[ui_gray_1]. Think unlocking access is too easy, or too hard? Tweak the requirements however you like. Choose whether neutral factions must also be unlocked, whether factions will ever revoke your access at all--and if they do, how long it takes.\n \n

            This unlock duration could be weeks if you like, or even a matter of seconds or minutes--with a low unlock threshold, short unlock durations effectively turn each PDA drop into a powerful but temporary buff. Or if you like a long grind for a longer-term advantage, that works too.\n \n

            %c[pda_yellow]It's your game. Play your way.\n 

            \n%c[pda_green]FACTION BLACKLIST\n
            %c[ui_gray_1]Sure, it makes sense that you could break into the networks of Duty or Freedom. And good Bandit infosec is when their network password is something other than sequential numbers or variations on blyat. But what about Monolith? Or ISG?\n \n

            If you don't think certain factions should ever show up on the map, don't worry--the %c[pda_yellow]Faction Blacklist%c[ui_gray_1] has you covered. Just check off which factions shouldn't show up, and they won't.\n 

            \n%c[ui_gray_1]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n
            %c[pda_red]TROUBLESHOOTING\n \n

            %c[pda_white]If you can see this encyclopedia entry at all, your binaries support DLTX. %c[ui_gray_1]Good job: having modded exe files is half the battle. Having updated addon files and the right options installed is most of the rest.\n \n

            %c[pda_red]Before reporting any issue:%c[pda_yellow] If your copy of Milspec PDA came pre-installed as part of a modpack%c[ui_gray_1] then it is possible that it's an old version, that not all of its features were installed, or that some of its MCM defaults have been changed. This is especially true if you have all the crafting recipes and still can't craft the T4 PDA, or if something related to Progression isn't working right.\n \n
            %c[ui_gray_1]
            In that case, it may be necessary to %c[pda_yellow]reinstall this addon from the FOMOD%c[pda_white] and ensure that the correct installation options were chosen for what you're trying to do.\n 

            \n%c[pda_red]IMPORTANT: To report any bug, you must do the following:\n \n
            %c[pda_white]1. Go to %c[pda_yellow]MCM > Milspec PDA > General\n
            %c[pda_white]2. Enable %c[pda_yellow]Debug logging%c[pda_white] and %c[pda_yellow]Verbose logging\n
            %c[pda_white]3. Exit and restart the game\n
            %c[pda_white]4. Reproduce the issue as simply as possible\n
            %c[pda_white]5. Get the game log from %c[pda_yellow](Your Anomaly Folder)\appdata\logs%c[pda_white] and post it somewhere online\n \n
            
            %c[ui_gray_1]If you do not, it is unlikely your log will have the information I need.\n

            \nI don't get notified about Moddb comments, so you will generally get the quickest response on the GAMMA Discord, in Milspec PDA's discussion channel. Unsolicited DMs will be ignored.\n

            Designed by an unknown entity for use by covert military or NGO operators, the %c[255,130,180,130]Milspec PDA%c[ui_gray_1], or "MilPDA" for short, is a sophisticated custom variant of the everyday PDA carried by nearly every stalker in the Zone. It has all the features found in ordinary commercial PDAs, but also includes a cryptographic module that enables the user to infiltrate many of the Zone's secure private networks using data downloaded from found or captured PDAs.\n

            \nWith the correct configuration settings, this allows the device to reveal the location of enemy squads operating nearby--provided the user has broken that faction's network security and gained access to their GPS data.\n

            \n• The PDA consumes %c[pda_white]0.2 mAh%c[ui_gray_1] per second of continuous usage.\n
