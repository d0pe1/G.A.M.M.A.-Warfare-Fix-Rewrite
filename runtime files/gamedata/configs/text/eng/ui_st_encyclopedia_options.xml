		%c[pda_white]INFORMATION:\n

		<text>%c[pda_white]Allows technicians to retain your equipment while they are theoretically repairing it.\n \n
		%c[pda_white]INFORMATION:\n
		%c[ui_gray_2]With this feature enabled, broken weapons, outfits, and other items brought to a technician will be kept in their possession until they have completed all repairs. After handing over your items you can speak with the technician to ask whether they are ready for pick-up, to which they will either return them or tell you how much time is still required. This adds a somewhat realistic enhancement to the traditional repair system and is suitable if you are seeking a more difficult experience, as it will no-longer work instantaneously.\n \n

		%c[ui_gray_2]It is highly recommended to only enable this feature if your system can maintain at least a steady 30fps, although 50+ is much more preferable. This feature can be toggled from the game options menu and is disabled by default.\n
