		%c[ui_gray_2]Warfare lets the player assume control of their faction. This is done at run time, and the player can choose between either the dynamic expansion system or the manual expansion system. The dynamic expansion system will adapt to any bases you captured in manual expansion mode when you switch back.\n \n
		With an offline combat simulator, squads can intercept other squads arbitrarily, so the Zone will be much more dynamic and large scale war will rage at the far corners of the map.\n \n

		%c[ui_gray_2]Reputation is similar to rank but differs in that it isn't quite so linear - being able to both increase or decrease based on your interactions with other stalkers rather than the environment.\n \n
		The easiest ways to increase reputation are by completing tasks, providing first-aid to those in need and killing your faction's enemies. Inversely, the easiest ways to lose reputation are by cancelling or failing tasks and killing neutral or friendly stalkers.\n \n
		It should be noted that whilst it is used by some features, reputation is largely immersion-focused and should not be confused with goodwill.\n \n
		The lower your reputation, the more other members of your faction and their friends will hate you. In extreme cases, they might even begin plotting your death.\n \n
