		<text>Factions will stash packages for you to locate using the RF Receiver. These packages may contain drugs, repair items, or ammo, along with potential bonus items such as additional drugs, valuable items, explosives, upgrade items, or "junk" artefacts.\n \n
		Packages are added to a queue every time you gain 250 goodwill with a faction. They are placed in areas outside the location where you earned the 250 goodwill that triggered the reward.\n \n
		You can only have one active package at a time. You can choose to collect the package or cancel it using the "Cancel RF Package" option in the PDA’s right-click menu. Canceling a package removes it from the queue. If it was your only queued package, you won’t need to gain another 250 goodwill to receive the next one.\n \n
		You can customize package reminders, automatic unpacking on pickup, and whether packages contain vanilla or modded upgrade items in the mod configuration menu under RF Receiver Package Options.\n \n
