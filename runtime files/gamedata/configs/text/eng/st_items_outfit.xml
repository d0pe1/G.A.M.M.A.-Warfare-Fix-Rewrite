	<string id="renegade_exo_outfit_description">
		<text>One of a few exoskeletons assembled by the Renegades back in 2011 to help secure their final push into Clear Sky's base. Unfortunately, they were virtually wiped out before their final victory ever came, thanks to the interference of a Mercenary with a trench coat and a marksman rifle. Modern Renegades who wear this armor always go into battle like a man possessed, eager to mete vengeance upon their most hated foes.\n \n

	<string id="greh_exo_outfit_description">
		<text>High-tech armor consisting of a steel-reinforced Kevlar jumpsuit and a tactical vest with Class IV inserts, all carried by powered limbs and servomotors. Study samples have revealed that its servos are made of alloys and materials unknown to any field of science in any other part of the world. Wearing this suit creates an unnatural feeling of bliss and calm within the wearer, although whether this sense of security is genuine or not remains to be understood.\n \n

If regular exoskeletons allow stalkers to feel like a light vehicle, the Nosorog almost makes them believe they're a main battle tank, able to withstand incredible punishment while carrying tremendous ordnance.\n \n
