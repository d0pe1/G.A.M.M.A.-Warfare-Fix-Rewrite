		%c[pda_green]Information:\n
		%c[ui_gray_2]Strong winds, storm clouds and a scarlet red sky all appear with the onset of an emission, followed by numerous eruptions of thunder and a deep rumbling. These events begin with a sharp surge in radioactive and psychic activity and end with destroying most life as waves of radiation envelope the Zone.\n \n
		Despite being extremely deadly, it is still quite easy to survive an emission by taking cover within buildings or underground tunnels until the event has run its course.\n \n

		<text>%c[ui_gray_2]The %c[pda_green]Brain Scorcher %c[ui_gray_2]is a former military installation that was seized by the group and became the first major application of mind control technology in the Zone.\n \n
		%c[pda_green]Information:\n
		%c[ui_gray_2]After the Soviet Union's dissolution, the Group continued the research started in Lab X-8 and adapted the installation at the Scorcher, or most importantly, the Lab X-19 located in an old bunker underneath the facility.\n \n
		When the Zone was created, the Scorcher was activated by the Common Consciousness in order to obstruct the way into the center of the Zone. The psy-emissions generated by the installation were effective at mind controlling trespassers and subjecting them to the will of the collective, creating mindless zombified stalkers out of some and raw recruits for the Monolith faction out of others.\n \n
		While the majority of stalkers who came too close to the Brain Scorcher became zombies, a group of stalkers known as Strelok's Group were able to slip past the Brain Scorcher (most likely with the help of Guide) and reach the center of the Zone. The path to the Scorcher and the installation itself is heavily guarded by the fanatical Monolith.

		<text>%c[pda_white]Phantoms %c[ui_gray_2]are illusory beings that exist within the mind, rather than the physical realm.\n \n
		%c[pda_green]Information:\n
		%c[ui_gray_2]Whilst difficult to classify as either an anomaly or a mutant, a phantom is an involuntary mental projection of a mutant currently found somewhere within the Zone. These projections are always accompanied by an audible "howling" noise and appear glowing and transparent, gradually floating toward the victim through walls and across the air.\n \n
		It is unknown why they only take the form of mutants, including those of which a stalker has never encountered, and as to why they never take the appearance of those that are now extinct, such as the Tark. A leading theory of this phenomenon suggests that the Zone's living mutants are in some way strongly connected to the Noosphere, and that through this a psy-field unintentionally imprints their visual appearance and hostile nature into the minds of its victims.
