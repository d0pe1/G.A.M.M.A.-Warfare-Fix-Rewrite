	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_task_chimera_scan_about">
		<text>Have you heard of the mutant called the Chimera? Scientists argue whether it's just an extremely deformed animal that somehow developed a human-like head or the result of unethical experiments. To figure it out, we need more data.\n \n
		Our team has built a device that can record brainwave patterns — the technical details would probably just confuse you. What matters is, we need someone to get close to a specific Chimera and record its brain activity while it's still alive. That’s the tricky part.\n \n
		Once you’ve got the recording, whether you leave the creature alive or not is up to you.
