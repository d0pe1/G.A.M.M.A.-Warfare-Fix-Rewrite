Kardan is an old alky, he gets drunk, but he can't tear off chairs.
Well, what about it? We need to take a better look around.
Bullshit, you fool.
He's got us jokers on our backs, we're young, we don't know a damn thing.
And the joker is good, too.
He got offended, grabbed it in his rucksack, and was done for.
While I was calming the gimbal down, took off in an unknown direction.
What am I supposed to do, drink with the old goat?
And the vodka is crap.
It was off to a great start.
