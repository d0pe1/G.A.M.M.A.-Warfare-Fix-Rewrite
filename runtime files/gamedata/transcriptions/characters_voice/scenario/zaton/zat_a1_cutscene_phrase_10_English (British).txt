In a changed environment, the National Security Council
Ukraine's defence has decided to immediately carry out
of special operation "Farwater."
Guided by the anomalous maps we've drawn up in advance
fields, dozens of military helicopters with paratroopers on board
are on a course for an emergency.
Despite meticulous preparations, the operation came to an end
a failure.
None of the vehicles returned to base.
