Anyway, here's the plan.
The chimera, it hunts at night, and so by morning, it's gone vlogging
snooze.
You can catch her at dawn, she's just about to be
will go to rest.
We'll crawl in closer and finish her off while she's drinking
in two holes.
Anyway, we just need to get together early, cross paths
I suggest 3:00 a.m. at the bar.
