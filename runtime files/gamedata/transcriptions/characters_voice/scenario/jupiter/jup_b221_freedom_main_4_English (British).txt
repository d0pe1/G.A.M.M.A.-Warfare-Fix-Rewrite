Have you heard the theme?
A longshoreman comes up to one of ours who's a bunker
guards and asks.
Professor, which artefact is better in a fight with the Comanches?
The one from the radiation?
Or the eye that heals wounds?
What about ours?
Fasting, son, for recuperation.
You'll be less out of breath by the time you get to your base.
