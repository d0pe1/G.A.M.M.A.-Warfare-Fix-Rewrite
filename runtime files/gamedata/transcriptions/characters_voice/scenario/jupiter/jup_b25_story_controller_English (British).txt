I'll tell you how to take out the controllers.
I'd recently acquired a bunch of artefacts, so I figured
to discount them on the call.
On the way back, I come to the stash.
And there's a controller in there, and he's not going to leave.
Here's Marro-ka on the spot, controller not controller,
and I have to pick up the Habar, and I'm having an epiphany.
If, I think, I close myself up with some kind of ironclad thing, I'm gonna have to do everything
I don't give a shit about his antics, and knowing that
I do.
I take the metal grate that was lying around, and I use it
so I'm just gonna close up on a quiet ramble.
And so while I'm grazing, while I'm getting my brains wired,
while I was wondering why I was so insensitive, I was already
and he came close, and fell on my head.
He's a hardy bastard, but I just threw the bars off,
he's gonna kick my brains out, but I'm gonna hit him with the butt of my gun,
he's quieted down right away.
