And if anyone thinks Flint's moving noodles
he'll come up to anyone on base and ask who's who
Flint.
Some hunters came across it one day, and they went straight for it, Flint
help me, oh, I can't do it without you.
You know, we wanted to kill the chimera, but we had to show him
the altitude of the flight.
I went straight to the vlog of one just outside the entrance, as always
set it up, herd when the chimera comes back to signal me,
and he fell asleep in the morning and missed the chimera
I got off my arse when I saw it, I had to do it myself
to fight back, but I did, as you can see.
