You know, the first time I saw our new squad,
I said, do you guys want a loan?
You are free people after all, and we respect freedom of choice, don't we?
Are they for me?
No, they're all under orders.
It's a lot of killing, and their eyes are empty.
And we've had enough of the zombies, that's enough.
