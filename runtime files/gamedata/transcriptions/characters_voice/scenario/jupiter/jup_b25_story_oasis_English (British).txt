About Azi, have you heard? Access to, have you heard.
I was really there.
First one to figure out how to get there.
Well, there's no mutants, no anomalies.
All is quiet, like my late grandmother's cottage.
And the artefacts are like cucumbers, one on top of the other lying shovelfuls of mushrooms.
Just the other day, I stopped by there for a little sunbathing.
Spend it? Hmm, that's not even funny.
And Azi, I'm sorry, is not rubber.
