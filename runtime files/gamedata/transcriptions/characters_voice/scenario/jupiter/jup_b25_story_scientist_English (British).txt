I've got all sorts of topics.
Like working for scientists. You did, didn't you?
Anyway, I stopped by his bunker one day.
Well punched in, and something to see what they're up to.
The professors were all shocked when they saw me.
Well, they say you're just the kind of guy we need.
Why do I ask?
Turns out they've got to put their gadgets under the anomalies.
These goggle-eyed men themselves don't want to go, of course?
Well, they promised bobos and goodies and stuff.
It's okay, I don't care. You were good.
Well, then I had to crawl around the neighbourhood.
Anomalies, monomalies.
Well, that's okay. That's normal stalker bullshit.
It was cooler later on when I started getting pledges out of professors.
