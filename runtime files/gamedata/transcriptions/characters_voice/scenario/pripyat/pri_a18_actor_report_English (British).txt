Colonel, there's something fishy going on here.
Inside the building was a crowd of Monoliths, as if in a trance.
Staring at a pile of rubbish and talking to it.
The rubbish I surveyed and discovered an interesting thing.
It's a kind of antenna.
It's like someone's messing with her
with the Monoliths, and these sessions are not being received
like God's revelation.
