Major, we're fucked.
Since the helicopters crashed, it's no longer an operation.
Discussion.
We're being taxed.
There's no communication with the centre.
And the situation is not expected to improve.
There is no air evacuation to look forward to.
The helicopters didn't come again.
And with all these casualties among the boys, soon there won't be anyone left to evacuate.
Control of the situation is gone.
We're in desperate need of a link to the centre.
