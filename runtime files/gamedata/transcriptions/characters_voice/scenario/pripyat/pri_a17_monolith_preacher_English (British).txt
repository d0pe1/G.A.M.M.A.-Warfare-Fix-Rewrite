We thank thee for revealing to thy servants the evil-doers of thy servants
ours.
And by thy shining light the souls of those who gave their lives in fulfilment
of your will, to fight, defenders of the monolith, to fight with a vengeance
of our fallen brethren, blessed be the eternal
their unity with the monolith is death, the fierce death of them,
who rejects its sacred power.
