I barely took three sips, I couldn't get it down, my throat felt like a vise,
my eyes are already spinning in circles.
So, I took five more sips, probably through and through,
threw a bottle at them, choking on it, you bastards.
That's when I let go.
And it says this.
Where did you go, Vanya? Where did you disappear to?
I haven't disappeared, Citizen Warden, I'm telling you.
I'm crawling away.
Oh, here we go again.
Don't be stupid, Vanya, if I catch you, it'll be worse.
That's when I realised.
Although the first one gave me a good kick in the head, the bitch lost sight of me.
It's got to flow.
Barely got to my feet, everything swaying like a nine-point bulk carrier.
So I go to the window, I lie back, nails are flying in the room.
My stuff from the pockets that bricks drop from above.
And shooping, cursing in my wake.
I'll get it, Kevanya, I'll get it, I'll get it.
