Okay, so he sat down, took a pebble of earth and threw it
on the vesicom.
Well, I think it stinks.
Breathe.
The pebble fell quietly to the ground as if it wasn't there
no anomaly.
He just fell down.
Well, I'm sweating.
My gut tells me it's a mansion.
I'm squatting on my hands and knees.
I'm throwing pebbles, it's a fucking reflex.
