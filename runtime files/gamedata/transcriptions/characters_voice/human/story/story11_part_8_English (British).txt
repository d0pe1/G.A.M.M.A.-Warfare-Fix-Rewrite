So, I jumped out of the window and went.
The stuff, the rjo, it's all left there.
How I got out of the zone drunk, God knows.
But I'm not going out of there now.
That neighbourhood.
I'm dead, but I'm not going.
I'm thinking maybe we should go to Cuchon's.
It's been a long time coming.
Rjo, footy.
All the stuff's gone, where's it all going.
Bitch.
That's what happened to me.
