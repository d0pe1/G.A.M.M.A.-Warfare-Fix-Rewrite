Remember, Duchmans, there's no rustle or movement,
it doesn't bother you, you just calmly drop the horn on the sector
and hit the bushes and trees, you'll blow your horn
and you fall behind cover on your back, the controller hooks up
if he sees you and then he needs time to adjust
on the victim, while you're sunbathing on your back flipping
and you put the short bursts on the mate and you put the short bursts on the gun
Patron, you count for three, you go for three, you go for three, you go for three
from there, sucking up information, suckers, be like me, you'll live to see
demobiles
