So I pushed the door, it was closed.
What's the matter, it's closed again.
So I open her bitch, and she bitch closes herself.
I realised that someone wasn't letting me through the door.
Well, I went through the window.
Inside, I took a breath, recovered a little, went to see who was
it's the one with the door.
And there's a big room with a long table in it,
like a motorway, and by the table there's a desk as tall as a
turret.
And then someone whispered in my head, and the sheh went.
Who are you asking?
