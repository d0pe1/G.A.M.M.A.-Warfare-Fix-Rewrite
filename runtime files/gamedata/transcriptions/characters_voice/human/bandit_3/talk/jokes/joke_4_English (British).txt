Two stalkers are walking on a tour through the forest.
Old to young here suddenly and gutturally.
It's like, go slowly to that tree over there.
Well, the young one did.
I got up to ask what's next.
And the other one's quietly asking.
Is everything okay in there or what?
It's kind of cool.
Aaaaaaaaaaah! Awesome!
I knew they were talking about that anomaly.
