Meet, in short, three stalkers at the dump, one has an eye out in reality, the other face all so specifically in the scar, and the third has no toe at all.
You know, like, they started asking, "Who's got this beauty?
The first one shows his eye and says, I'm the one who clipped the guys, I had to shoot back.
It's all kind of respectful, I guess, okay.
The other one's poking his face, I'm the one who insists, I'm all in the dosobahs.
It's all so respectful, normal, respectful.
They look at the third one, and he's kind of confused, so he doesn't say anything.
Hey, mate, what happened to your leg, I ask you?
Yes, he says, he ploughed for the boys in the camp, so he put on lead pants so that he wouldn't become impotent from radiation.
So I put it on, so what?
It's a rubber band burst.
