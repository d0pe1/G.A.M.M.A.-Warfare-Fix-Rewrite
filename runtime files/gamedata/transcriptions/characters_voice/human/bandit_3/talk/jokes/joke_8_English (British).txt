Three stalkers are walking along and, like, they're trying to figure out who's the coolest.
The first one says, "I'm a tough guy, I've killed three bandits.
And the other one, no bro, I'm way cooler, I've killed ten men.
And the third one, the tonuvas are suckers, I've put a hundred of them down.
And then, you hear, they see a tired-looking kid walking by,
in a leather jacket so shabby, and she's whistling something,
like Vladimir Central.
Stalkers - oops, fell out on treason, and in the bushes hiding.
Well, the kid didn't notice them, just kept walking.
And they're sitting there, like, one day.
Hey, guys, what's this bzlo?
Second - no, well, really bzlo, what's the big deal?
And the third - why are you staring at me? I'm hating you!
