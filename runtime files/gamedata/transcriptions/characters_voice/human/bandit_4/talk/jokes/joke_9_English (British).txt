two bloodsuckers are squabbling
One of them was like
How do you hunt stalkers?
So he's like, well
So I spot a stalker
Then I make a big circle around it
In five minutes, little one
It's not until another five minutes later that I attack
First one like that, I don't get it
Well, what's the point, mate?
Do laps, like, any way you can bowl at once
And the other one was like, no bro
You don't know the subject
You can hit me right away, no problem
Only then you'd have to eat it with shit
