It's like, what, where, when, the presenter is like this, and the question will be asked by a real kid in a van.
Dear connoisseurs, two months ago my friend Kalyan borrowed five kosari from me and did not pay me back.
A month ago Kalyan borrowed three grand from me and hasn't paid me back.
A week ago he borrowed only fifty dollars, but he didn't give it back either.
Anyway, the fucking question is, who's in the black box?
