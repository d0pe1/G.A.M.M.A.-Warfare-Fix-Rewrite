One mate asks the other.
Hey, what are you doing in the zone?
I ran away from the police station, so I thought I'd take refuge here.
What'd you go to the cops for?
You're welcome!
Stopped as usual, everything wrong with them.
Rooms are dirty, no first aid kit.
Driving on red, oncoming traffic,
backwards, drunk, with five guns in the boot.
