It's like what's going on, where, when, the presenter's like, what's the question?
will be asked by a real kid in a van.
Dear experts, two months ago, my mate
Kalyan borrowed five grand from me and didn't give it back.
A month ago Kalyan borrowed three grand from me and hasn't paid me back.
A week ago he borrowed only fifty dollars, but he didn't give it back either.
Anyway, the fucking question is, who's in the black box?
