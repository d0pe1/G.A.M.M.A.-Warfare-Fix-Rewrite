two bloodsuckers are talking, one to the other like, "How do you hunt stalkers?
I noticed the stalker, then I made a big circle around him.
After five minutes small, and only after another five minutes attacking.
First one, I don't get it, what's the point, mate?
What's the point of these circles, like, at any rate, you can immediately bowl for khazhivat, and the other one is like, like, no bro, you don't know the topic.
You can hit him right away, no question, but then you'll have to eat his shit.
