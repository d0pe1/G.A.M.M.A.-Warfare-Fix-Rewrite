Two bloodsuckers, one to the other. You're like a stalker on the hunt, aren't you?
I notice the stalker, then I make a big circle around her in 5
for five minutes and then I attack after five more minutes, and the first one's like that
I don't get it. What's the point, mate? What are you doing with these circles?
You could have some meat, and the other one would be like, "I didn't pay attention to the topic, you don't know what to do
You can do it right away, but then you'd have to eat it with shit
