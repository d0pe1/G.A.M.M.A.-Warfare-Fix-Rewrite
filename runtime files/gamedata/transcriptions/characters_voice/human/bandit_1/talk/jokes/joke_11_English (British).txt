Three stalkers meet at the dump, one of them has his eye out in real life, the other one has a scarred face
third toe has no toe at all
you know, like asking who got the beauty from where
The first one shows his eye and says I'm the one who killed the guys
I'm just kind of nodding respectfully, okay?
The other one's pointing at his face. I'm the one who's got the pseudo-dogs on his face, I'm the one who's got the bug
All right, that's fine. They're looking at the third one, who's kind of confused, so he's not saying anything
You hear your mates asking what happened to your leg?
I went to the camp and put on my pants so they wouldn't become patents from radiation
So I put it on and the rubber band burst
